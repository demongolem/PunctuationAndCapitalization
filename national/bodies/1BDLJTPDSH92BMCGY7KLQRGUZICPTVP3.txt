A California woman has been missing since last week after going hiking in a popular national park, authorities said.
The woman, 38-year-old Holly Suzanne Courtier, was last at about 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 6 after getting off a private shuttle bus in Zion National Park, according to the National Park Service and local reports.
Her daughter, Kailey Chambers, told CBS that she’d been traveling the country and visiting national parks since losing her job as a nanny because of the coronavirus pandemic.
“She was on a shuttle into the park around 1 p.m. and she never got back on her shuttle to come out of the park back into town,” Chambers told the network, adding that her mother is an experienced hiker who has visited the park previously.
The National Park Service released details about what Courtier may have with her or may be wearing.
She is possibly wearing a Patagonia Black Nano Puff Jacket, a Dark Tank Top and a Danner Trail Gray Hiking Boots, according to the agency.
