Syrian President Bashar al-Assad visited the northern Latakia governorate on October 13, to inspect damage and meet locals following wildfires in the area, Syrian state media reported. The United Nations reported that up to 140,000 people “were affected through destruction of and damage to homes and assets” by multiple fires in Latakia, Tartous, and Homs. At least three people were killed in Latakia, the UN said via ReliefWeb. Video released by the Syrian Presidency shows Assad asking residents about the response to the fires and the damage in their area. One man tells Assad that residents required water hoses so they could respond to fires as early as possible themselves. Credit: Syrian Presidency via Storyful
