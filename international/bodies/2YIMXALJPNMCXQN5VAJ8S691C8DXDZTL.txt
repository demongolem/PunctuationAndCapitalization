There are some England nights when the formation jars and the selection looks unfamiliar but as Gareth Southgate surveyed this particular experiment he could at least say with certainty that Jack Grealish has shown his unique talent has a place in this side.
Where that talent is deployed and how will be a question for future games, but in a disjointed opening it was Grealish’s performance which gave the England manager most food for thought – although he was not the only outstanding player from outside Southgate’s regulars. There was a debut goal for the unstoppable Dominic Calvert-Lewin and then, when he vacated the No 9 role in the second half, Danny Ings moved over and scored on his first England start with an overhead kick.
Suddenly from a dismal opening in which England were outpassed by Ryan Giggs’ team in the first Wembley international in 11 months, a new set of options opened up to Southgate from the fast-breaking Harry Kane-centric side he was finessing one year ago. The usual regulars were absent from this friendly - Kane was not even on the substitutes’ bench - and in their place was a different kind of attack.
At its heart was Grealish, coming off the left side on his right foot - his considered, languid style creating the first goal for Calvert-Lewin. The Aston Villa captain comfortably played the game at his pace and generally drew the opposition onto the kind of repeat fouls that have become familiar to him in the Premier League.
This was Grealish’s first start for England, just his second cap, with the strong sense that Southgate has been sceptical about him in the past. It is five years since Grealish declared for the nation of his birth over Ireland, the same year he starred, aged 19, in a FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. Even now one wonders how much Southgate would be prepared to adapt a system built on the blistering pace of the likes of Marcus Rashford and Raheem Sterling, to suit Grealish’s different style.

Yet there were others who have had to be patient too, including Ings, a favourite of Southgate and making his first ever start for the national team, although not initially in his preferred No 9 role. He started out on the right where he worked away on the opposite side to Grealish as a more typical winger, springing a throughball into Calvert-Lewin for his first chance of the game until later, with the Everton striker substituted in the second half, Ings was given the central role.
His goal was beautifully taken, little more than a half chance when Tyrone Mings, a second half substitute, nodded a corner down behind the Southampton man and Ings improvised superbly. There was a leap and a twist and he executed a right-footed overhead kick past Wayne Hennessey. Ings’ all-round game was tidy and sharp and his goal came within five minutes of being moved into his optimum position.
For Calvert-Lewin, the remarkable season continues. Ten goals in seven games for club and country and this one virtually unmissable for a red-hot centre-forward, once Grealish had picked him out in the six-yard box with that reliable right foot. Calvert-Lewin was one of four debutants on the night, with Bukayo Saka and the second half substitutes Reece James and Harvey Barnes. All three goalscorers were scoring their first goals for England – the first time that has happened since 1963.
The other was Conor Coady, scoring on just his second cap and his first goal for club or country in 112 games. He ended the match as England captain as the armband went from its original recipient, Kieran Trippier, to Joe Gomez in the same triple substitution and ended up with the man from Wolverhampton Wanderers. Trippier, who had an indifferent first half, had drifted a free-kick across the Wales area for Coady to connect unmarked at the back post. As ever that free-kick had been won by Grealish.
It had fallen into place in the end for Southgate although he will have wondered whether he had got it right for much of the first half when England simply did not have enough of the ball. They were confronted with the unusual prospect of a confident Wales midfield directed by Jonny Williams, of League One Charlton Athletic, stroking the ball around with authority.

Giggs had anticipated the three-man England defence, made explicit over the course of the week. His wingers, Rabbi Matondo and Connor Roberts positioned themselves wide and England’s wing-backs, Trippier and Saka, were obliged to go out there to cover them. Giggs has precious few resources to marshal and he lost Kieffer Moore to injury early on which forced another reorganisation. He had five Championship players and Williams of League One in his first XI. Of his six substitutes, four were aged between 19 and 20 years old with 12 caps between them before this night.
It was pointed out that this England team had more total career appearances in the Football League than the Premier League. The EFL itself had made a big play in a Twitter thread of the Football League backgrounds – either on loan or at parent clubs - of this England side. No coincidence that it is at loggerheads with the Premier League over homegrown quotas post-Brexit.
Without the big two of Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey, Wales never quite created the chances when they had the ball. Even so Giggs will have been disappointed in the 25th minute that Ethan Ampadu did not take the opportunity to get tight to Grealish and force him down the right wing. Instead he was able to deliver the ball to Calvert-Lewin to head in the first goal.
On Sunday the world’s No 1 ranked team Belgium come to Wembley. One supposes that Southgate will return to a more familiar side, with Kane, Rashford and others and expect to have less of the ball than England are accustomed to enjoying. But if that does not work, he knows there are different options available with Grealish among them.
We have a few articles up now for you to enjoy if you'd like to read more on England's performance. There's this from Jason Burt:
And here's a love letter (I presume, I've not read it yet!) to Jack Grealish from Matt Law:
There we go. Wales started better but didn't make use of possession, England punished dreadful defending three times to score and ended up coasting to the win. As I say, Grealish, Ings, Coady and Calvert-Lewin took their chance. 
England stroking the ball around, the substitutes getting a lot of it as the game comes to an end. Has felt like a friendly from start to finish tonight but Grealish, Ings, Coady and Calvert-Lewin have taken full advantage to push for a place in the starting XI.
The physio is taking his time with Mepham. Might be a twisted knee. Hopefully it's nothing to do with his ligaments. 
Maitland-Niles has made a couple of attacking runs into the box from left wing-back, which appears to be his new position even though he's actually a central midfielder. Williams does really well to put the Arsenal player off, tracking him all the way back to the bench.
The bad thing is that Mepham has gone down injured and looks to be in a but of pain, as though he knows something has happened that he doesn't like.
Excellent banter in the commentary box. Dixon and Coleman joke about having to stay longer to do the highlights show. Coleman says 'it's alright, I think my wife's had enough of me anyway at home all the time!' doing the classic pub joke bit. Sam Matterface takes a beat and says 'I'm sure that's not true'.
It's a joke, man.
Matondo is quite a tidy player, great footwork, likes to take on his man. He's hardly seen the ball tonight either, which is a shame. 
Phillips has just played Ings into space on the left with an absolutely brilliant long pass. It looked like he'd overhit it and just given the ball away but as the ball drops behind the defence, it's obviously a fantastic spot.
Winks, Grealish, Ward-Prowse, and Saka off, Maitland-Niles and Barnes on. Grealish is man of the match for me, Clive. Oh Clive. I wish Clive were here.
Williams and Roberts off, Smith and Gunter on for Wales. Harvey Barnes is getting ready to come on for England, who are enjoying themselves now. 
WHAT A SAVE! Wow! That's a brilliant save! Great play by England, Grealish drives through the middle and finds Saka on the overlap in space inside the area. Saka takes a touch, sets up the shot and drives it across goal but it takes a deflection and Hennessey reacts while diving to get a strong wrist behind it and claw the ball away. 
Wales put some passes together and work the ball into the final third... but Vaulks punts his shot way wide and high.
Mason Mount is on for Ings by the way, I've forgotten to mention that while trying to write about the goals. He's gone wide right of the front three, no change in system. 
Ings should maybe have a second goal as Grealish creates another opportunity with some skill on the left of the box. Ings doesn't quite read it and attack the near post but had he gone for a dart across the defender, would haev had a tap in!
DANNY INGS HAS A GOAL!
Wales are good everywhere except the final third and in their own box, which unfortunately are where most of the action happens. A cross is put in the box, bounces around and Ings has time and space to pull off an overhead kick inside the six yard box. Dreadful defending. It's a mix of man and zonal (I think) but none of it is good.
England look a lot better in this half and as Coleman has just said, as I was typing it (honest) the main difference seems to be the distancing between players. The wing-backs are getting further forward earlier to help form the midfield four and not leave Winks and Phillips stranded in the centre. The distance between defender and striker is shorter too (spoke about that earlier, so there's your proof I'm not plagiarising pls believe me).
Ampadu has been booked for bringing Grealish again and could really do with being a bit more subtle/careful from now on. Grealish appears to have his number. 
Trippier and Gomez go off, James and Mings come on. Coady is now the England captain...
Ampadu seems to have decided that his new mission is kicking Grealish off the pitch and that task was what led to the free-kick which England scored from. It's one of the reasons I'm surprised Southgate doesn't want Grealish in his starting XI - England seem to mostly score from set pieces under this manager and Grealish wins about 20 a game.
COADY SCORES!
First England start, first England goal 🤩Take a bow, Conor Coady - that's the first time the @Wolves defender has scored since April 21, 2018! 😱Watch @England 🆚 @Cymru LIVE 📱 👉 https://t.co/S2ScihpivE📺 👉 @ITV pic.twitter.com/le4uHMoOja
It's his first start for England and that is a tidy finish indeed. Trippier hooks a brilliant cross to the back post, Coady arrives unmarked and just puts his foot through the bounce, pinging the ball into the back of the net. Dreadful marking from Wales.
Coady doesn't read a ball over the top very well and Roberts is able to run in behind him, though drags his shot harmlessly wide without power. 
You know what this game needs? Clive Tyldesley.
I'm really enjoying Coleman's commentary, he's gone into full tactics mode and explaining why and how certain things are happening. It's so refreshing. Ahhhhhh. None of the 'he should have done better's that usually turn commentary into a cliche toilet.
We're back!
I'm not so sure. They've really underperformed and produced one tiny bit of quality attacking play... and that's all it's taken. Wales look well drilled and know what they're doing but just seem to lack the players to take the game to England.
England have the lead, Jack Grealish is really good, and honestly that's about all we've learned so far. 
Grealish is so good. He hasn't done much tonight other than the assist, and been involved in every decent England attack they've put together so far, but he's so clearly of this level. Looks a natural. I mean it is Wales but you know what I mean.
Roberts looks to have gone through the middle, Williams is wide right. He's usually a full-back so to play right wing is a little different. Let's hope he does well.
Roberts is booked for leaving a little extra on Saka while going in for a 50/50. He's a bad one actually - that's a Sunday League mis-timed lunge, not an international match level tackle.
Saka decides to get involved - because he's barely had a touch - and drives up the pitch on the underlap, helping create a chance for Coady to score inside the area by taking the ball all the way to the box and winning a corner. Wales don't defend it particularly well either and are lucky that Coady punts his shot over the bar.
Moore has gone down with an injury, clutching his toe. He's going to have to come off, it looks like.
Williams is getting ready to come on which should mean a change in system for Wales.
1985 - Dominic Calvert-Lewin is the first Everton striker to score for England at Wembley since @GaryLineker in October 1985 vs Turkey. Toffee. https://t.co/TCPKfmX6rQ
Ampadu has just - JUST - gotten away with a slack turn and pass near his own area, acting as the pivot while Wales build from the back and almost handing possession to the England forwards in a dangerous position.
Southgate is making use of a break in play to tweak something with his forwards, presumably to get the team moved up the pitch as a unit and shorten the distances between striker and defenders. They're too stretched at the moment.
Moore gets into the box but Pope comes off his line quickly to smother. Wales still the team in control of possession at the moment.
Coleman has just offered this take on Mepham's defending for that goal:
"I don't know if he's got his distances wrong.... but he's in the wrong space, he's got to be touch tight." 
CALVERT-LEWIN SCORES!
It's taken @CalvertLewin14 just 26 minutes to mark his @England debut with a goal! 👏🅰️ Games in 2020/21: 7⚽ Goals in 2020/21: 10THIS MAN IS ON FIRE! 🔥Watch @England 🆚 @Cymru LIVE📱 👉 https://t.co/S2ScihpivE📺 👉 @ITV pic.twitter.com/PjtTSNt4M4
He's scored on his England debut! And it's a brilliant header. What a player this guy is turning into. Grealish creates it with some excellent play on the right wing, finds space to cross and lifts it onto the head of the striker. England have the lead and they just don't deserve it all, but that's how football works! Possession means nothing unless you use it.
The England press looks a little disorganised. Players don't seem to be sure when and where they should run, who they're closing down, or where they want to show the ball as a team. Grealish and Ings doing a lot of running/jogging for absolutely no reason. You could turn the picture off and just listen to the commentators as a podcast and draw the same level of insight from the game. Nothing is happening.
Hennessey is almost caught out by Ings again! England are so deep though that there are no supporting players in the press, so Wales just pass their way through the press and midfield. You can tell this team hasn't played together before. 
Wales are the better team by miles here. England defending as though the inferior team, struggling to get on the ball. 
Wales are happy to pass patiently around their own half, controlling the game. Possession is turned over after a long move and a ball is pinged miles forward beyond the last man. Calvert-Lewin is ready, tries to control by the box.... but just can't take it down. Great run, very good pass.
Matondo cuts in from the left wing and shows a lovely turn of pace to accelerate into the pitch... but underhits a pass to the opposite side and gives the ball away.
A cross is hooked into the area for Calvert-Lewin, who climbs all over Keane. The pair get in each others' way and any hope of a chance is gone.
Ings chases the ball down as Hennessey tries to kick it out, blocking the clearance but only bouncing the ball behind for a goal kick this time. That's the warning for the Wales goalkeeper!
Ah there's another star of the Sunderland documentary, Jonny Williams. It must go well for him there if he's playing tonight, I have high hopes for the end of that series.
Meanwhile, on the pitch, there's not much going on. Although Moore has just managed to skip away behind the defence out wide, cuts it back and Wales win a corner. Coleman has just pointed out the danger of playing a back three is that the wing-backs often drop deep to help and make a five, which isn't actually what you want sometimes.
Lee Dixon is co-commentator! How I've missed his wisdom. One of the best co-commentators in town. A wild Chris Coleman has just appeared. I've been enjoying his w ork on that Netflix Sunderland documentary but I'm only half way through so have no idea what happens. Pretty sure it's all going to work out really well for old Chris!
Here we go! 
The absence of fans in the stadium means we can hear the England players 'singing' the national anthem, except none of them appear to be able to do that, and so it sounds like a row of men are trying to summon Cthulhu with a monotone spell. Awful.
England-Scotland under-19s game called off at half-time today due to a positive Covid test for Scotland manager Billy Stark. Rest of Scotland backroom team and players now into 14 days self-isolation
The England squad haven't mixed with the Under-19s so there's no danger of playing tonight, but you have to wonder what the point of this game is. Have I mentioned that yet? It's one of those where in a couple of years everyone goes 'oh yeh that probably shouldn't have happened, ah well'. 
That last sentence is the absolute key here. Even Southgate doesn't really want or need this game.
Not only is he captain tonight, he's also the only surviving member of the 2018 World Cup team to play in the first XI. As in the others are on the bench or unavailable. They're all alive.
You're waiting for England-Wales and have a look at Emmerdale for the first time in 30 years.When did they stop calling it Emmerdale Farm.
The sound of the music from Emmerdale gives me instant flashbacks to being at home and realising that in just a few hours I'd have to be asleep and then go to school again, rather than being allowed to play Fifa 95 on the Megadrive. Horrifying.  
Remember him? What a player. The entire Juventus squad has been put into isolation since Sunday after two non-playing staff tested positive for Covid-19, which is why he hasn't arrived to remind us all what we're missing out on. Late runs to the box. Now we remember.
This game should give both managers the chance to try a new tactical system or different players within it and without fans in the stadium to provide an atmosphere, it could end up either a dull draw or an exciting all-action tactical fascination. Games without crowds are a little slower and can be influenced by the manager more, partly because their shouts can actually be heard across the pitch. We've had a heap of goals in the Premier League so far this season, it'd be great if this turned out to be a seven goal thriller.
We're in international mode right now (oh god we're trying), which is good, because like everything else in the world, club football in England appears to be falling apart.
Football traditionalists have to accept the domestic game’s pyramid is broken, writes Oliver Brown. Here's a little snippet for you:
I think the shape is a 3-4-1-2, with Grealish behind Ings and Calvert-Lewin. Saka is left wing-back, which sort of works, but Gomez-Coady-Keane sounds like something you only try on Pro Evo because all of them have the upwards arrow. It's only a friendly though. Doesn't really matter. Nothing matters. Football!
And would you look at that? Jack Grealish starts! And there's a picture of Bakayo Saka on the tweet. What a world we live in.

England vs Wales... the FRIENDLY! Are you pumped? Can you feel the energy pulsing through the air? That's right, it's international friendly time - not even Nations League - in the middle of a pandemic, with growing troubles all over the country, in an already packed fixture schedule, with nothing really to play for... I can't wait. 
Imagine the excitement in the England camp, a group of players simply desperate to maintain fitness and not pick up injuries, all while putting in enough effort to convince Gareth Southgate to pick them. Wales get the opportunity to put one over their regional rival (I'm Scottish, I understand) which is at least something, but they are in precisely the same boat. The same socially distanced boat.
Speaking of Wales, their manager Ryan Giggs has been talking about young Daniel James and the difficulty he now faces getting into the Manchester United first team:
“Another winger coming in would mean maybe less games,” Giggs said. “That’s up to DJ to step up when he does get the chance.”
"DJ was excellent in both last games. He made the goal in the first and was brilliant for us. He had not played a lot but looked sharp.
“Dan has friends here. He always enjoys coming away, the training, the atmosphere, playing for the country.
“He has got speed that always keeps the opposition interested. He has that directness as he showed in our last games. If he has not been playing it gives him the opportunity to get minutes."
James should be involved tonight, which might one little thing to come out of this. What will the headlines be after? Jadon Sancho still hasn't signed for United? James shows United they don't need Sancho? Why did this friendly take place? All the answers coming up, at some point after 9:45 when the game has finished.
