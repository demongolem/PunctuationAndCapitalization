 dean koontz admits it was “Kind of frustrating” a few months back when an idea that he predicted the coronavirus in his 1981 novel the eyes of darkness took on a life of its own online 
“It was one of those internet things thats mostly bogus” said koontz “I had a book 40 years ago mention the wuhan virus and it came from a lab in china i didn’t make a prediction of a pandemic it was a totally different story my first strategy was just ‘Don’t engage in this and it will go away’ and it just didn’t go away social media has got a light side and its dark side”
The author 75 has a new book out called “elsewhere” about jeffy and amity — a single father and his 11-yearold daughter — moving through life as best they can after their wife and mother michelle disappeared seven years prior dad meets an eccentric scientist who presents jeffy with whats described as a “Key to everything” holding the ability to time jump among among parallel universes the discovery opens up a bevy of possibilities for jeffy and amity including meeting up with michelle but also danger — because there are people who really want that key and would kill to get it.
In a recent interview with the associated press koontz talks about his well of untouched ideas adapting his writing for hollywood and publishing with amazon answers have been edited for clarity and brevity.
Ap youve written more than 100 books do you ever have trouble coming up with new ideas
Koontz i have a drawer in my office that when i get an idea that’s not too horrendous i scribble it on a piece of paper i put it in that drawer and i’ve always said “when i run out of ideas for my next book i’ll pull one out” i’ve never had to there’s always new ideas i think imagination is like a muscle and the more you use it the more ideas come to you 
Ap “elsewhere” paints such a vivid story you havent had your writing adapted in awhile would you be open to that again
Koontz i am open to it but i never have any high expectations my film agent has “elsewhere” out to market i just havent had a lot of luck with that after the 1995 film “Hideaway” starring jeff goldblum i considered tying an anvil around myself and leaping off a bridge stephen sommers made a very nice version of “odd thomas starring anton yelchin in 2013 but it was crimped by the fact that about halfway through the money ran out and he had to cut the budget but it was still good.
Ap you now have a publishing deal with amazon whats that like a lot of authors have a lovehate relationship with amazon.
Koontz it always comes down to the people you deal with its astonishing that everyone that ive been working with at amazon have been very creative very efficient just fun to work with a lot of it is its a younger group and that sort of astounded me too 
Ap do you see a point where you would want to stop writing koontz has already delivered book no 79 to his publisher.
Koontz ill probably stop when i fall dead and hit the keyboard time will stop everybody but ive had some reviews saying that the books are almost better than ever and thats gratifying as long as its still play and its still fun and i get positive letters from people thats better than sitting by the pool with an umbrella.

Kpop supergroup bts has risen to become one of the world’s most popular musical acts but just three days before its company big hit entertainment’s big ipo it was hit with an unexpected stumbling block in the chinese market a single sentence about world history that has sent brands fleeing.
In a speech to accept a prize earlier this week from the korea society a new yorkheadquartered nonprofit that seeks to build mutual understanding between the us and south korea band member rm said “we will always remember the history of pain that our two nations shared together and the sacrifices of countless men and women”
He added that it was especially meaningful to accept the general james a van fleet award which is awarded for those who have made “outstanding contributions.” to promoting uskorea relations this year the 70th anniversary of the korean war.

Although he made no mention at all of china chinese internet users and staterun media were quick to slam the comment for not acknowledging the sacrifices of chinese soldiers who fought with north korea against the us and the south.
Hashtags claiming that “Bts humiliated china” were trending in china monday with one user writing “If you want to make money in china you should consider the feelings of chinese fans.” the tabloidesque global times trumpeted that “the band’s totally onesided attitude to the korean war hurst the feelings of chinese netizens and negates history”
Major companies samsung hyundai and fila appear to already be distancing themselves from bts in china appearing to pull ads and products affiliated with the group in what are likely attempts to avoid boycotts from passionately nationalistic chinese consumers.
On monday a bts collaboration specialedition purple smartphone disappeared from samsung’s chinese website and other chinese online sales platforms though bts has been fila’s brand ambassador since 2019 and worked with hyundai since 2018 both companies pulled mentions of the band from their official chinese social media accounts
Even china’s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao lijian chimed in on the matter monday asked whether the ministry felt that rm’s comment was a “Matter of national dignity” he said “we all should learn lessons from history and look forward to the future hold dear peace and strengthen friendship”
Big hit entertainment will go public in seoul on oct 15 with an initial public offering that is expected to value the firm at 41 billion making it south korea’s largest in three years last year the firm made 97 of its revenue from bts
China still unofficially bans the import of south korean cultural products an action that has lingered since 2017 it came about due to beijing’s anger at the country’s deployment of the us thaad antimissile defense system imports of korean films are still not possible
Although some Kpop artists have signed endorsement deals with chinese companies earlier this year in what was seen as a potential sign of a thaw a lift of the ban in the near future remains unlikely.

“there are signs of optimism compared with four years ago when Kpop stars were removed from advertisements but it’s too early to interpret it as anything more than what it actually is” lim daegeun a professor of chinese interpretation and translation at hankuk university of foreign studies in seoul told the korean herald back in may noting that “despite the ban being a topdown order there’s always been demand for korean content in china”
With the rise of nationalist sentiment among young consumers stoked by major war films including “Jingang chuan” a korean warset blockbuster helmed by guan hu “the eight hundred” and frant gwo “the wandering earth” set to release oct 25 that could change.
While the chinese internet was busy bemoaning bts’ supposed politics the rest of its fandom on twitter a platform blocked in china was collectively celebrating its new chart records.
On monday bts became the first asian artist in history to simultaneously hold a song at no 1 and no 2 on the billboard hot 100 with “savage love laxed – siren beat” by jawsh 685 jason derulo and bts and the Kpoppers’ first englishlanguage single “dynamite” respectively.
They’re now one of just five groups to have ever done so alongside the beatles the beegees outkast and the black eyed peas and the first to do so globally since the black eyed peas in 2009.
“what i’ve learned from touring across the world is that our thoughts are not so different even if we are in different places the feeling of sadness anger and being touched is similar everywhere i go” said band member jung kook in the same korea society acceptance speech for which china is criticizing him.
“I hope that our music plays a role as a link that allows people from all around the world to understand and respect on another”

Actor maureen lipman has been made a dame in the queen’s birthday honours list this year.
The 74-yearold actor was awarded the honour for services to charity entertainment and the arts she has been a regular presence on tv and stage since the sixties.
Her wideranging career has included everything from a comedy role in a bt advert to playing a supporting character in roman polanski’s oscarwinning drama the pianist.
Born into a jewish family in hull in 1946 lipman studied at the london academy of music and dramatic art lamda before being cast in early film appearances such as 1968 drama up the junction.

In 1974 lipman married playright jack rosenthal with whom she had two children rosenthal died in 2004 – lipman later said she found it “Impossible to grieve” because her instinct was to make people laugh.
“Id feel terrible about the fact i didnt look like i was grieving enough” she said.
In film lipman received a bafta nomination for her supporting role in educating rita the 1983 comedy drama starring sir michael caine and dame julie walters.
She later starred in roman polanski’s 2002 biographical war drama the pianist as the mother of adrian brody’s lead character władysław szpilman

Lewis star has been served cease and desist letter.
Find your bookmarks in your independent premium section under my profile
Laurence fox has been threatened with legal action over his plans to set up a political party called reclaim.

A small manchesterbased charity with the same title which supports workingclass teenagers said it would face “substantial damage” from any association with the controversial actor they have presented him with a cease and desist letter.
Olivia an 18-yearold who has taken part in the charity’s schemes told the guardian that laurence fox’s attempt to use their name is “completely wrong” and feels like another example of workingclass people “getting pushed aside”
A spokesman for the reclaim party project told the publication “we are aware of the charity’s view while pointing out the obvious fact that no party name has actually been registered lawyers are looking at their recent contention”
Fox announced last month that he would be launching a new political party to fight the socalled “culture wars.” the group was described by one westminster source as “Basically a Ukip for culture”
A report in the telegraph stated that fox had raised more than £1m including sums from former tory donors.
He is reportedly hoping to stand dozens of candidates for his new party at the next general election.

It has apparently been set up to provide a political movement for people who are “tired of being told that we represent the very thing we have in history stood together against”
A twitter account has already been set up for the new reclaim party though the name has not yet been formally approved by the electoral commission.

Fox was initially bestknown as the star of tv drama lewis which ran between 2006 to 2015.
The star has been in the spotlight since january this year when he appeared on the BBc’s question time and made headlines for refuting claims that the media’s treatment of meghan markle was racially motivated.

He said the row was “boring” and claimed “It’s not racism we’re the most tolerant lovely country in europe”

In an april interview with the sunday times fox revealed that his appearance had caused a row with his brotherinlaw actor comedian and writer richard ayoade after fox begged him to support his stance on social media.
Ayoade who is halfnigerian was reportedly furious at this and told fox “you have never encountered racism”

Fox responded “yeah of course i have i’ve encountered racism from black people towards me when i was working in kenya as a safari driver for seven months it’s the way you’re spoken to — racism can be deferential”

Asked by the interviewer what he meant by the idea that “Racism can be deferential” fox answered “this is why you don’t get actors involved in chats like this because i’m just not smart enough to do it.”

Midfielder assisted dominic calvertlewin’s opener and shone elsewhere in the friendly at wembley.
Find your bookmarks in your independent premium section under my profile
One of the big debates this week has been why these international friendlies are even being played but jack grealish at least offered one fine reason to watch.
He was gloriously creative in a match that otherwise felt fairly predictable and rather pointless without a crowd.
Gareth southgate dominic calvertlewin conor coady and danny ings for their part would say very differently.
It was a night of firsts in that regard not least an england international at wembley with no fans that is something that will have marginally taken away from genuinely special moments for these players.
Calvertlewin got a debut goal coady and ings got first goals and southgate got a few pointers and potential solutions for euro 2020 it felt instructive that on what was grealish’s own first start he set up england’s first goal from open play since kosovo his work also won the freekick for coady’s goal which involved a typically fine delivery from standin captain kieran trippier.
Grealish is very simply great to watch – and uniquely difficult for defenders to pin down.
Wales meanwhile didn’t get much out of this at all other than a fairly chastening 30 defeat and a look at how they may approach some of the bigger international sides at next summer’s euros.
This is what these matches are partly supposed to be about as well as badly needed income for the national federations all of that starts to feel much less pressing among rising cases of coronavirus across the continent and particularly among international squads.
That is why the debutants – calvertliewin and bukayo saka – will have curious memories of their first games they were successes nonetheless.
Calvertlewin’s opening goal was of the classic numbernine type that he has already offered regularly for everton this season supremely set up by grealish it was such a divinely inviting ball and the kind of finish calvertlewin talked up in the buildup to the game.
The two are going to give southgate some big decisions ahead of the euros.
They might not even be that big by that point they may be obvious for now with the forwards it feels like southgate is going to have to pick one of calvertlewin tammy abraham and danny ings behind harry kane the everton striker is currently well ahead in that race.
Grealish is meanwhile probably looking to be one of two to complement raheem sterling with jadon sancho and marcus rashford.
The villa playmaker does offer something very different in his languid play and a hint of the wild card that can outfox defenders he is almost unique as a playmaker in the modern premier league and in this game gave southgate’s side a greater freedom 
While sancho and rashford have tended to scorch backlines for england stretching the pitch grealish is more withdrawn there are times when he doesn’t seem to be moving that much at all he hadn’t actually been out on the right once until the minute of the goal when he then got it there and clipped in that inviting cross.
He can carry the ball and dribble in ways that had gone out of the game but may be becoming more important than ever now that pressing reigns.
Grealishs contributions did make elements of this game more compelling and potentially consequential.
It still felt relevant that england’s next two goals came from setpieces even if one was as inventive as an ings bicycle kick. 
That does touch on a wider debate around this team can southgate develop a system that makes the side more penetrating in open play with this midfield are england too dependent on set play.
One of the great ironies of southgate’s search for a system that works is that what is best for england may not necessarily be best for winning tournaments
There’s first of all the issue that even if he eventually gets the midfield right the personnel mean it’s not going to be as commanding as those of france germany or spain as such england are going to have to adapt in those games that for his part is the variety that southgate is trying to find.
More generally there is an interesting discussion to be had over what is the optimum approach at this level.
We know well what it is at club level that is frenetic pressing of a level of coordination that creates chaos married with controlled possession such a combination is achievable with clubs however because of the amount of time they have to train together for managers to drill their players.
That just isn’t possible with countries there is nowhere near enough time to develop that cohesion unless you have a core of players from one club so attempting it will inevitably lead to gaps in the team and maybe a fair bit of sloppiness.
It might just be that a slightly outdated approach in the club game represents the most effective at international level that would be locking games down at one end and waiting on individual inspiration at the other this is partly how france have become the best in the world even if there is a lingering frustration that so many talented players are utilised in so constrained a manner.
That is the other side of it it isn’t exactly great to watch and speaks to some of the issues that the level has seen in contrast to the club game.
Grealish made this match worth watching but not necessarily worth playing.

The initiative began as a project by the global children’s charity plan international growing out of the company’s because i am a girl campaign which highlighted the need for greater education medical care and legal rights for young women in developing countries.
After gaining traction the campaign was adopted by the un and turned into the global initiative it is now.
Each year has a different theme the first was “ending child marriage” and the second in 2013 was “Innovating girl’s education”
The fundamental aim of the international day of the girl is to raise awareness of the challenges that girls in developing countries face via social media.
Each year achieves different things depending on the theme.
For example the aim of the inaugural international day of the girl was to combat the fact that 12 million girls under the age of 18 would be married that year while 21 million girls in developing countries aged 15 to 19 would become pregnant.
While child marriage remains a concern projects such as the international day of the girl help to highlight the prevalence of these issues provoke important conversations at a governmental level and inspire others to act.
This year’s theme is “my voice our equal future” and calls on people to seize the opportunity to be inspired by what adolescent girls see as the change they want the solutions big and small.
It also derives from the world conference of women that took place 25 years ago in beijing bringing more than 30000 women from 200 countries together with the aim of recognising the rights of women and girls as human rights
By the end of the conference a new policy agenda was born the beijing declaration and platform for action prompting a wave of movements tackling issues such as reproductive rights to equal pay.
Today these movements have expanded the un states on its website they are being organised by and for adolescent girls and tackling issues like child marriage education inequality genderbased violence climate change selfesteem and girls’ rights to enter places of worship or public spaces during menstruation girls are proving they are unscripted and unstoppable
At an individual level getting involved largely centres around spreading awareness something the un encourages people to do via social media under the hashtag dayofthegirl 
There are also a number of small organisations taking on the challenges outlined by the un which you can get involved with including the malala fund girls not brides shes the first and camfed.

The initiative has been running since 2012.

Grealish has waited so long to be able to call himself an england international he is simply enjoying the experience of achieving a deeprooted personal goal.
Find your bookmarks in your independent premium section under my profile
“I was desperate” says jack grealish finally able to call himself a fullyfledged england international after a manofthematch display on his first senior start “I was absolutely desperate to come here”
The fiveyear anniversary of his decision to represent england rather than the republic of ireland fell at the end of last month and if not for marcus rashford’s withdrawal from september’s camp through injury it would have passed by without a single cap to grealish’s name.
That would have been extraordinary not only given how he has picked one of the most historic clubs in english football up off the canvas and dragged them back to the premier league over the last five years but also when considering the long painful tugofwar for his allegiance.
The whole saga dominated grealish’s adolescence but may have been avoided if not for a freak accident while he was away with the england development setup as a 15-yearold he cannot remember exactly what happened especially well apart from a few basic details 
“I woke up in the middle of the night i went to go to the toilet and then my roommate - who was diego poyet gus poyet’s son - he heard a bang and then i just woke up in the bathroom” he recalls “I didn’t want to go home the following day but england said they thought it was best that i did from then on i went to play for ireland through the youth levels and i played for them because of how much i enjoyed it.”
Grealish always felt a strong affinity with ireland qualifying through not just one but three of his grandparents and he spent much of his youth in solihull playing gaelic football but things change.
“as i got older i realised i am english my family is english and in the future that’s what i want to do” he says “I want to play for england and i’m just so grateful and thankful to the manager for making it happen i want to be in the squad now for the next however long - five six years - and i want to have a long england career and get many caps”
At 25-yearsold he is starting slightly later than planned gareth southgate was still strangely reluctant to use grealish as recently as late august when the england manager explained that he was behind rashford raheem sterling and jadon sancho in the pecking order for a place on either the left or the right flank grealish was not disheartened “let’s be honest it’s the truth isn’t it 
“you look at these guys and the numbers they have got over the last couple of years and you understand why they are touted as the best wingers in the world” he says “I fully agree with that i have full respect for that but i also have respect for how much ability i have got i have respect for myself and i know what i can do”
Grealish does not just see himself as a winger though “when you talk about positions i had a long chat with the manager in the last camp he is good for that you know he lets you speak to him and he lets you speak your mind really i said to him at the time i see myself playing as no 8 for england i see myself playing as no 10 i see myself as a leftwinger or a rightwinger wherever i am on the pitch i will play i am one of these people who just loves football i’m a footballer i couldn’t care less where i play”
The truth is that grealish has waited so long to be able to call himself an england international he is simply enjoying the experience of achieving a deeprooted personal goal and doing what he loves in a new and different environment “sometimes you come away from villa… i have known villa my whole life it’s always been ‘Villa villa villa’ – i have never been anywhere else” he says “sometimes it is nice to have that change of scenery 
“but it is the standard that these guys set they are the top players you only have to look at harry kane… he is first on the training pitch he is first in the meetings he is last off the training pitch he is practicing his finishing freekicks every single day sometimes it makes you think ‘You know what no wonder he is one of the best strikers in the world’ you see that and it makes you want to go back to villa and set them standards around the place”
If the response to his performance against wales is anything to go by grealish may soon be setting standards at international level as well as with his club southgate described him as a “Matador” postmatch  a player willing to make himself a target for the entertainment of others an england player with grealishs combination of flair courage and technique is a rare thing there is an obvious comparison to draw 
“I know about gazza” grealish says “do you what i don’t really see myself as him but i would love to be like him the way that he played football he played with such… i don’t know what the right word is – but he played football with such joy i think everyone who watched him could see that that is what i want to do one of the biggest compliments for people to say to you is that you make them happy watching football”

Who stands a chance of making southgate’s final 23man selection.
Find your bookmarks in your independent premium section under my profile
England face two nations league encounters with belgium and denmark at wembley over the next week with their preparations for the delayed euro 2020 well underway.
Gareth southgate’s side will play croatia the czech republic and the winners of a playoff in the group stages of next summer’s tournament with all three of their games to be held at wembley 
Southgate arguably has the largest pool of talent to select from since his appointment as manager four years ago but will have to disappoint many players when finalising his 23man squad.
Who is all but certain of a place and who is merely in contention who has work to do and who is an outside bet 
Harry kane.
England’s captain and still their best striker despite a few doubts this time last year kane is not the same player he once was but may be a more rounded one becoming a provider as well as a goalscorer.

Trent alexanderarnold.
Arguably the most important player in the best team in the country if england can unlock the creative prowess that alexanderarnold regularly displays for liverpool he could be a gamechanger for southgate

Raheem sterling.
Sterling quietly recorded the best goalscoring season of his career last year with 31 goals in 52 games for manchester city despite that record doubts persist over his finishing but he is unmistakably one of england’s most talented players.

Jadon sancho.
Arguably the most naturallygifted player in england’s ranks still only 20-yearsold and with a summer of speculation finally behind him sancho should only develop further and will want to add to his somewhat meagre total of only two international goals.

Harry maguire
Restored to the squad after the mykonos incident maguire is viewed as england “senior central defender” by southgate and part of the leadership group that is extremely unlikely to change between now and next summer.

Joe gomez
One of several southgate favourites and now a premier league champion gomez can be sure of a place on the plane and a role alongside maguire in the centre of defence provided he can stay free from injury which ruled him out of the 2018 world cup.

Ben chilwell.
In a talent pool not blessed with many leftbacks chilwell is the outstanding candidate by far whether he is worth the £50m fee which chelsea paid for his services this summer is debatable but he is a good attacking fullback who complements southgate’s system.

Jordan henderson.
Henderson’s presence was missed during the september camp despite all he has achieved over the last 18 months the liverpool captain is underrated by many and all but a certainty for southgate’s final squad given his influence and experience.

Jordan pickford.
While there are valid questions about pickford’s form over the last 18 months and whether he will still be england’s firstchoice goalkeeper by the summer his place in southgate’s squad appears secure the no 1 jersey not so much.

Marcus rashford.
Rashford has struggled for consistency since the back injury in january which may have ruled him out of the original euro 2020 even so if he is fit it is hard to see a world where the manchester united forward is not part of southgate’s summer plans.

Declan rice.
England’s best option in the holding midfield role for now rice is still only 21-yearsold and has started showing the potential to become a reliable ball-winning midfielder will that be enough at a major international tournament next summer.

Harry winks.
Winks is arguably rice’s main competitor for the deepestlying midfield role but is more about retaining possession than winning it southgate is clearly a fan naming the tottenham midfielder in every squad since the nations league

Nick pope.
Likely to travel as southgate’s secondchoice goalkeeper though could push for a starting spot if pickford underwhelms pope’s prospects may suffer if burnley’s poor start to the season stretches into the winter with the turf moor club going through a difficult time.

Eric dier.
Having reinvented himself as a centrehalf and gradually worked his way back into the international fold dier can be confident of a place in southgate’s final squad provided that his displays for tottenham in that position hold up to scrutiny.

Mason mount.
Another southgate favourite even if it can be difficult to see where exactly mount fits into england’s system the biggest threat to his international place comes from hakim Ziyech kai havertz and christian pulisic pushing him out of the starting lineup at chelsea  
Kieran trippier.
One of the squad’s older heads now trippier has quietly impressed since taking the plunge and joining atletico madrid last summer southgate has not forgotten about him including him in every squad since despite a growing number of options at rightback.

Tyrone mings.
Despite only winning his first cap last year at 26-yearsold mings already appears to be a player southgate trusts his leftfootedness is no small part of his appeal at centreback and aston villa have made great strides defensively over the last few months.

Danny ings.
If southgate wants to employ a high pressing style where england chase the ball from the front he could do worse than starting ings the southampton striker’s scoring record over the last 18 months is just as impressive as his work offtheball too.

Dominic calvertlewin
This may be uncapped calvertlewin’s first callup but his form is no flash in the pan and has been generally impressive since ancelotti’s appointment at everton the 23-yearold offers a varied skill set up front which is an advantage over some of his rivals for a place.

Phil foden.
exiled for now southgate has spoken about ‘Rehabilitating’ foden and mason greenwood after their breach of coronavirus protocols in iceland and surely will do once the dust has settled foden in particular offers a creative spark that england generally lack.

Mason greenwood.
Like foden out in the cold after their disciplinary breach at the last camp greenwood arguably faces greater competition for a place too and it remains to be seen how edinson cavani’s arrival at manchester united will affect his playing time at club level.

Tammy abraham.
Abraham was vying with kane for a starting spot this time last year but his early season form tailed off and he now faces stiff competition from timo werner at chelsea has every chance of earning a squad place so long as he does not become a fringe player at stamford bridge.

Bukayo saka.
Included in southgate’s senior squad for the first time saka’s leftfootedness and ability to play anywhere down that flank stand in his favour eligible to play for nigeria and will still have a choice to make even if he wins his first cap due to a change of fifa’s rules.

Dean henderson.
Easily one of england’s three best goalkeepers based on his displays at sheffield united last season but may need to replace david de gea as manchester united’s firstchoice in order to be assured of a spot.

Michael keane.
Keane has started the new campaign in excellent form at everton and appears to be enjoying a new lease of life under carlo ancelotti this has not gone unnoticed by southgate though will need to be maintained.

Jack grealish.
Despite only being 25-yearsold grealish already feels destined to finish his career with fewer england caps than his talent deserves southgate has voiced doubts over where exactly aston villa’s captain fits into england’s system.

Kyle walker.
Manchester city’s starting rightback but walker’s callups have been sporadic since the world cup given the competition he faces in the position he cannot afford sendings off like late on in the 10 win over iceland in september.

Ainsley maitlandniles.
Maitlandniles has earned his second straight callup after a strange rebirth as arsenal’s utility man could he do the same for england his ability to deputise at leftback is useful though he will need to stay in mikel arteta’s thinking as well as southgate’s

Reece james.
One of the few young english players at chelsea who is not suddenly under threat from a new recruit but james still has cesar azpilicueta to contend with if he is going to earn the minutes required to be alexanderarnold’s euros backup.

Harvey barnes.
Another firsttime callup barnes has become a dangerous wide forward under brendan rodgers’ tutelage at leicester city faces stiff competition in his position but could be hard to ignore if he enjoys a breakout season.

James wardprowse
Achieved something approaching cult hero status for scuffing up the penalty spot before iceland’s late miss in september though will hope that is not remembered as the pinnacle of his international career his ability from setpieces is a useful trait to have at a tournament.

Kalvin phillips.
Debuted against denmark in september whether phillips is trusted to be england’s deepestlying midfielder at the euros will depend on how he manages the step up from the championship to the premier league his profile is one the squad desperately lacks.

Conor coady.
Coady received his first longawaited callup for september’s camp and has retained his place the wolves captain is more suited to a threeman defence rather than southgate’s usual four and a switch in formation - for coady’s debut against denmark  did not pay off.

James maddison.
Still uncapped despite entering his third season of premier league football at leicester city maddison is similar to grealish in that he is yet to fully win southgate’s trust england’s lack of a no 10 role also appears to count against the 23-yearold.

Ross barkley.
A regular england squad member this time last year barkley gradually fell out of favour under frank lampard and now finds himself on loan at aston villa as with maddison southgate said he was not considered for this camp due to a lack of match fitness.

Callum hudsonodoi
Another player on the fringes under lampard whose international prospects have been damaged as a result hudsonodoi’s pathway to regular minutes is unclear given all the competition in attack at stamford bridge.

Callum wilson.
All of wilson’s four caps have come under southgate but he was overlooked for these internationals despite a fast start to life at newcastle with calvertlewin and ings in form too it may prove difficult to win his place back.

Fikayo tomori.
Another chelsea youngster to slightly fall by the wayside though tomori’s chances began drying up before their summer transfer splurge needed a loan move to be assured of regular playing time and now may need to look again in january.

Dele alli.
The forgotten man alli’s last international appearance was at the nations league finals more than a year ago but he will need to win back the confidence of jose mourinho at club level before an england return will be considered.

John stones.
The other forgotten man stones appears to have little hope of nailing down a regular place at city following the arrival of record signing ruben dias and consistent impressive performances may be required in order to win back southgate’s favour.

Alex oxladechamberlain
The barrier to oxladechamberlain playing more regularly for club and country is the same as it ever was fitness the liverpool midfielder has missed the start of the new campaign with a knee injury a run of good form late in the season may be his best hope.

Jamie vardy.
Vardy did not announce his retirement from international football after the 2018 world cup instead merely ‘Walking away’ from the england setup southgate remains in contact and the door is open but a return appears unlikely for now.

Luke shaw.
Shaw has not played for england in more than two years and has been injured for each of his last four callups despite a lack of leftbacks and his regular starting spot at united southgate seems to have moved on.

Michail antonio.
Uncapped yet in form with 12 league goals since the restart david moyes has made the most of antonio’s unique skill set at west ham leaving doubts as to whether he would fit into southgate’s system but a sustained scoring run would become hard to ignore

Aaron wanbissaka.
Arguably the best oneonone defensive fullback in the country yet still uncapped at senior international level wanbissaka is an unfortunate victim of england’s rightback surplus but his own limitations going forward cannot be ignored either.

Tariq lamptey.
Lamptey’s displays for brighton since establishing himself as a regular under graham potter have caught many an eye with bayern munich even keeping tabs on the 20-yearold but he is another one to suffer from england’s wealth of talented rightbacks.

Ben white
Namechecked by southgate during the lockdown as a thenchampionship player who could make the final squad lamptey’s club teammate white has an outside chance if he can replicate the form from his loan spell at leeds in the top flight.
Aaron ramsdale
England’s firstchoice goalkeeper at under21s level has an opportunity to claim one of the mandatory three spots in next summer’s squad but will need to improve on a slow start to the season with sheffield united.

Jude bellingham.
At just 17-yearsold bellingham is already starting in the bundesliga and impressing for dortmund following his £228m move his age and relative inexperience count against him but if he is still a regular come the end of the season he could be hard to ignore

Midfielder assisted dominic calvertlewin’s opener and shone elsewhere in the friendly at wembley.
Find your bookmarks in your independent premium section under my profile
One of the big debates this week has been why these international friendlies are even being played but jack grealish at least offered one fine reason to watch.
He was gloriously creative in a match that otherwise felt fairly predictable and rather pointless without a crowd.
Gareth southgate dominic calvertlewin conor coady and danny ings for their part would say very differently.
It was a night of firsts in that regard not least an england international at wembley with no fans that is something that will have marginally taken away from genuinely special moments for these players.
Calvertlewin got a debut goal coady and ings got first goals and southgate got a few pointers and potential solutions for euro 2020 it felt instructive that on what was grealish’s own first start he set up england’s first goal from open play since kosovo his work also won the freekick for coady’s goal which involved a typically fine delivery from standin captain kieran trippier.
Grealish is very simply great to watch – and uniquely difficult for defenders to pin down.
Wales meanwhile didn’t get much out of this at all other than a fairly chastening 30 defeat and a look at how they may approach some of the bigger international sides at next summer’s euros.
This is what these matches are partly supposed to be about as well as badly needed income for the national federations all of that starts to feel much less pressing among rising cases of coronavirus across the continent and particularly among international squads.
That is why the debutants – calvertliewin and bukayo saka – will have curious memories of their first games they were successes nonetheless.
Calvertlewin’s opening goal was of the classic numbernine type that he has already offered regularly for everton this season supremely set up by grealish it was such a divinely inviting ball and the kind of finish calvertlewin talked up in the buildup to the game.
The two are going to give southgate some big decisions ahead of the euros.
They might not even be that big by that point they may be obvious for now with the forwards it feels like southgate is going to have to pick one of calvertlewin tammy abraham and danny ings behind harry kane the everton striker is currently well ahead in that race.
Grealish is meanwhile probably looking to be one of two to complement raheem sterling with jadon sancho and marcus rashford.
The villa playmaker does offer something very different in his languid play and a hint of the wild card that can outfox defenders he is almost unique as a playmaker in the modern premier league and in this game gave southgate’s side a greater freedom 
While sancho and rashford have tended to scorch backlines for england stretching the pitch grealish is more withdrawn there are times when he doesn’t seem to be moving that much at all he hadn’t actually been out on the right once until the minute of the goal when he then got it there and clipped in that inviting cross.
He can carry the ball and dribble in ways that had gone out of the game but may be becoming more important than ever now that pressing reigns.
Grealishs contributions did make elements of this game more compelling and potentially consequential.
It still felt relevant that england’s next two goals came from setpieces even if one was as inventive as an ings bicycle kick. 
That does touch on a wider debate around this team can southgate develop a system that makes the side more penetrating in open play with this midfield are england too dependent on set play.
One of the great ironies of southgate’s search for a system that works is that what is best for england may not necessarily be best for winning tournaments
There’s first of all the issue that even if he eventually gets the midfield right the personnel mean it’s not going to be as commanding as those of france germany or spain as such england are going to have to adapt in those games that for his part is the variety that southgate is trying to find.
More generally there is an interesting discussion to be had over what is the optimum approach at this level.
We know well what it is at club level that is frenetic pressing of a level of coordination that creates chaos married with controlled possession such a combination is achievable with clubs however because of the amount of time they have to train together for managers to drill their players.
That just isn’t possible with countries there is nowhere near enough time to develop that cohesion unless you have a core of players from one club so attempting it will inevitably lead to gaps in the team and maybe a fair bit of sloppiness.
It might just be that a slightly outdated approach in the club game represents the most effective at international level that would be locking games down at one end and waiting on individual inspiration at the other this is partly how france have become the best in the world even if there is a lingering frustration that so many talented players are utilised in so constrained a manner.
That is the other side of it it isn’t exactly great to watch and speaks to some of the issues that the level has seen in contrast to the club game.
Grealish made this match worth watching but not necessarily worth playing.

1 grealish stakes claim for key england role
Reading football twitter you would think jack grealish had suddenly burst on to the scene this season he was sensational in aston villa’s demolition of liverpool and he was fantastic again here against wales but he was doing the kind of grealish things he has been doing for several years his ability to drift past opponents shield the ball draw fouls and create opportunities for teammates is as good as anything england have right now and the only mystery is why it has taken gareth southgate so long to harness those skills his talents are not dissimilar to paul gascoigne albeit a lofty comparison and in the same way grealish can add an xfactor to this team to unpick better defences than this in the months and years to come.
2 calvertlewin and ings readymade understudies.
England have been searching for a reliable understudy for harry kane since jamie vardy retired from international football marcus rashford is better attacking from wide while tammy abraham is yet to find consistency but in dominic calvertlewin and danny ings gareth southgate has quality in abundance both took their first england goals with aplomb and most importantly played in a manner akin to their premier league form while there is an argument to pair one of the duo with kane in attack it’s more likely in the short term that they compete to be first man off the bench when called upon and they both showed here that they are worthy of the role
3 pope is england’s best goalkeeper.
It is a long time since jordan pickford was england’s best goalkeeper probably stretching back to the 2018 world cup of course it was his excellent and dependable work in russia which earned southgate’s trust and cemented his place as no 1 but that position is surely no longer so solid now while pickford has been making a series of errors in the premier league over the past 12 months or so burnley’s nick pope has seemed near imperious and pope showed exactly what he has to offer with a composed display and clean sheet at wembley it may not have been the stiffest of tests but pope showed in his demeanour that he feels he belongs in the england team the question now is whether southgate agrees.
4 343 still raises questions.
This was a far better england performance than the stale draw with denmark last time out but there were still periods of the match particularly in the first half when the midfield four appeared disjointed from the front three southgate has said he believes it could be a formation that england use against high quality opposition and it makes sense to trial sooner rather than later but neither wales nor denmark represent the kind of calibre the manager is preparing for the result was good here but the performance wasn’t always controlled and there remain plenty of question marks over whether england should continue towards euro 2020 with the 343 shape 
5 coady here to stay.
Conor coady’s delight after scoring was joyous and to cap off his day he finished the game wearing the captain’s armband too could he be a longterm solution in what has been a problem position for england in recent years time will tell but the early signs are promising

Jadon sancho and tammy abraham are back available for england after a coronavirus breach that left manager gareth southgate once again navigating a very difficult moral maze
Mason greenwood and phil foden are absent from the three lions international triple header as punishment for breaching the strict bio bubble during last months nations league trip to iceland.
Southgate has had another covid-19 headache to contend with this time after footage emerged of sancho abraham and ben chilwell breaking the governments rule of six guidelines at a party last weekend.
The trio missed thursdays 30 thrashing of wales as a result but sancho and abraham are available for sundays nations league clash against starstudded belgium.
Chilwell remains absent through illness and will be tested to see if he can face denmark on wednesday with southgate keen to move on from an issue that has led to scrutiny over his handling of such incidents
Its a very difficult moral maze and youre having to make decisions that are impossible really on how you treat all these different incidents that weve had to deal with over the last few months the england manager said.
Where we have been fairly consistent is that the lockdown breaches that have happened away from our camp players have been selected.
There were some breaches in the summer - were not condoning were not encouraging that we recognise the responsibilities - but we were consistent in that thinking.
These lads have missed one match already theyve missed a chunk of the training so other players have gone into the team and done well so theyve found themselves in a more complicated situation because of that.
I dont think its comparable to what happened last month because thats a completely different set of circumstances in my view.
But i cant sit here and say i have got all of these things right its impossible what is right.
Everybody is going to have a view on that so i have to make decisions that i feel are right for the culture of the team first and foremost.
Theres additional scrutiny because were the national team and judged differently to any club decision but at this point i am not going to lose sleep over that.
Well try to do the right thing well try to have as much consistency as we can
But also im not standing on my moral high horse saying were the guardians of everything thats great and we are beyond criticism or reproach.
We recognise for the whole country this is a difficult period.
experienced defender kyle walker flouted coronavirus regulations during lockdown while aston villa captain jack grealish was hauled over the coals for breaching rules.
The 25-yearold has since gone on to break into the england squad and flourished on his first start winning the manofthematch award for his display in the friendly thrashing of wales.
Southgate is not buying into the comparisons to paul gascoigne other than their shared ability to beat players with the three lions boss facing a clamour for grealish to start on sunday.
Weve got six matches over the autumn and the physical condition of those players across those matches is really important he said.
Its not just tactical about how we prepare the team this week but physical across the whole squad and we have some great options for how we approach the game and the way to play.
Im in a fortunate position that weve got decisions to make on who starts and even given the size of the squad who we have on the bench thats not so straightforward but its a good position to be in
England are expected to name a much more experienced side on sunday with harry maguire in line to win his first cap in nearly 11 months.
The manchester united captain missed the last international gettogether following court case in greece and has struggled for form at club level this season.
Were delighted to have him back with us - hes an absolute top player said southgate who says maguires united teammate luke shaw is more than capable of being the best leftback in the country despite his continued absence from the england setup.
Theres obviously a lot changed in his life a lot that hes gone through over the last couple of months.
A different level of scrutiny on his performance because hes the captain of manchester united but hes absolutely outstanding as far as were concerned.
Hes been pivotal to every good performance that weve had over the last few years and the success of the team a lot of that has resided on having his stability and ability to bring the ball out from the back.
We couldnt have more faith and belief in what is possible for him hes a big big player for us.

 tanzanian authorities have intensified repression to muzzle the opposition civil society and the news media ahead of elections on october 28 where the incumbent president john magufuli is seeking a second term an international human rights group said monday 
In recent months the media has been the hardest hit with the government indefinitely banning the tanzania daima newspaper the countrys secondlargest newspaper amnesty international said in its report.
The governments june 23 banning order accused the newspaper which is owned by opposition leader freeman mbowe of breaching the law and professional ethics without citing specific laws or stories that were allegedly illegal or objectionable
In july the tanzanian communications regulatory authority banned kwanza tv for 11 months for airing a health alert on covid-19 that was issued by the us embassy said amnesty.
International media coverage of tanzania’s elections has been limited by the government which amended laws to require international radio and television broadcasters to have licensed local partners in order to get the regulatory body’s permission to air content said the report.
With just over two weeks to the elections opposition parties allege that hundreds of their candidates have been unfairly disqualified the report said opposition party leaders have accused the zanzibar election commission of being reluctant to issue voter identification cards to qualified voters.
International and local rights groups have previously said tanzanias democratic space has shrunk since magufuli come to power five years ago repression has increased as he seeks a second fiveyear term they say.
Magufuli’s autocratic tendencies became visible early in his presidency the report said using his partys parliamentary majority magufuli’s administration has passed several pieces of repressive legislation extending the governments control over the country’s politics and society 
“a july 2016 blanket ban on political rallies until the 2020 election campaigns has been selectively applied against opposition parties whose leaders have faced intimidation harassment arbitrary arrest and prosecution on trumpedup charges.” the rights groups said.
Since then the judiciary has been weakened through executive appointments without independent parliamentary vetting resulting in several politically motivated trials the report said 
In 2016 the government enacted the media services act that empowered the government to suspend and close media outlets for reporting on allegations of corruption and human rights violations said the report 
The 2018 online content regulations and the 2015 cybercrimes act gave tanzania’s government sweeping powers to police the internet leading people to selfcensor their online postings it said.
“cumulatively these changes have significantly eroded the rule of law and undermined respect for human rights” the report said.
During this period there was an attempted assassination of leading opposition candidate tindu lissu who was shot 16 times another leader of his party was attacked and his leg was broken by unknown assailants after he criticized the governments response to the covid-19 pandemic.
Another opposition leader has been arrested several times since magufuli came to power and has been charged with various offenses including convening illegal meetings.
Magufuli has declared that tanzania no longer has a problem with the coronavirus as covid-19 has been defeated by prayer his government has not reported any new cases of covid-19 since april the president has refused to combat the spread of the virus by banning any kind of gatherings — except opposition political rallies.
According to tanzanias election authority more than 29 million voters have registered to vote at the more than 80000 polling centers across the country.
The amnesty report was compiled through 29 phone interviews as researchers could not travel to tanzania due to covid-19 travel restrictions.

After mondays explosive icac revelations here are the contenders most likely to replace gladys berejiklian as nsw premier should she resign.
The 38-yearold member for epping has served as the state’s treasurer since january 2017 succeeding gladys berejiklian when she was elevated to premier.
The leader of the nsw liberals right faction has for several years been touted as a potential successor of ms berejiklian but has been left bruised after the recent icare scandal.
Treasurer dom perrottet has been touted as a potential successor to premier gladys berejikliancreditnick moir.
While mr perrottet is regarded as intelligent and capable by many of his colleagues some believe it might be too early for him to assume leadership of the party and the state
A devoted catholic mr perrottet opposed the state’s recent legalisation of abortion and spoke of the importance that faith had played in the development of people in his maiden speech.
The father of six who practised as a lawyer before entering parliament was the president of the nsw young liberals.
The minister for planning rob stokes was elected to parliament in 2007 and handed his first ministry in 2014.

The member for pittwater was considered a frontrunner to replace his good friend mike baird as premier when he resigned in 2017 but was overseas when the decision was made to appoint ms berejiklian
The 46-yearold belongs to ms berejiklian’s moderate faction within the liberal party and is a key ally of the premier.
Mr stokes was at the forefront of the recent civil war that erupted within the coalition over the government’s controversial koala planning policy.
Andrew constance has endured a tumultuous 2020 in which he signalled his intention to resign after bushfires tore through his south coast electorate before briefly throwing his hat in the ring to contest the federal seat of edenmonaro.
The 46-yearold transport minister has long held leadership aspirations and gained popularity during the black summer bushfires for openly criticising the prime ministers handling of the crisis

However his move to contest a federal byelection in may blindsided some colleagues and damaged his long standing relationship with nationals leader john barilaro who was also expected to run.
That personal feud landed on the front page of the daily telegraph prompting mr constance to pull out of the campaign before it had begun.

He is viewed as a safe pair of hands having avoided controversy.

The nsw energy and environment minister and leader of the party’s moderate faction matt kean’s numbers will likely have a substantial bearing on who the next premier could be
While regarded by some colleagues as “the man in waiting” others believe it is too early for the 39-yearold to take the reins.
Mr kean was first elected to the legislative assembly as the member for hornsby in 2011 and was first elevated to a ministerial position in 2017.
While mr kean is the leader of the moderates he does not control the totality of its numbers.
Stuart ayes has enjoyed a relatively quick ascent of macquarie street since he was first elected in 2011 when barry o’farrell led the liberal party to a landslide victory.

Copyright © 2020Hours before rick maddison shot and killed queensland police officer brett forte the toowoomba senior constable spoke to his killer on the phone.
A preinquest hearing in brisbane on tuesday into the deaths of senior constable forte and maddison who was later fatally shot by police in a siege in the lockyer valley heard the inquest would likely be conducted in early 2021.
The scene of the siege near gatton in may 2017credit-jorge branco.
The hearing was told maddison was known by police as a dangerous and probably armed offender who had been hiding off the grid while police were searching for him.
The court heard maddison had developed a deep paranoia that police were targeting him after charges dropped in 2015 were laid again in 2017.
Gatton police investigating reports of gunfire put a camera up near the bush property where maddison was hiding out but did not tell toowoomba police.
Days before the shooting on may 24 2017 maddison called toowoomba police and was extremely aggressive and could be heard punching the phone booth accusing police of harassing his family.
Two days later maddison found and moved the camera which the court heard fuelled his paranoia.
Counsel assisting the coroner rhiannon helsen told state coroner terry ryan that the night before the shooting maddison stayed at a friends place leaving in the morning to buy alcohol.
He returned furious claiming that his pension had been cut off ms helsen told the court.
He showed his friend what he described as a heap of guns that were placed in the rear seat of his vehicle
An autopsy report showed senior constable brett forte had been struck by bullets repeatedly across his bodycreditsean baumgart.
Maddison told his friend everything is already arranged.
Just after 1pm maddison called toowoomba police station and spoke initially to constable forte then demanded to speak to a more senior officer.
While he spoke to the senior officer who urged him to surrender and come in to the police station senior constable forte his partner senior constable catherine nielsen and other police searched toowoombas public phone boxes.
Towards the end of the call maddison states stop playing games youse you know where i am ive made it fing easy enough for you ive left trails ms helsen said.
Maddison was spotted by police and a pursuit began senior constable forte repeatedly warned his colleagues over police radio to be aware of firearms but police did not know maddison had access to automatic weapons.
Maddison turned onto a dirt embankment and down a forestry track only some 4wd police vehicles including one driven by senior constable forte at the front could continue the chase
At 218pm maddison reached the gate to the property where he had been hiding got out of the car and began firing on senior constable fortes vehicle behind him.
As officer forte urgently reversed rounds of ammunition were penetrating the vehicle unfortunately it ran up an embankment and rolled trapping both officers inside ms helsen said.
Later ballistic testing found the police vehicle was hit by 27 bullets six of which entered the cabin
Police officers who were following requested urgent assistance and under fire from maddison helped senior constable nielsen and senior constable forte from the car when it was discovered senior constable forte had been shot.
He was taken to a queensland ambulance service staging area nearby but was declared deceased a short time later.
An autopsy report showed senior constable forte had been struck by bullets repeatedly across his body including the right forearm which ms helsen said caused extensive haemorrhage and his death within minutes.
Police briefly lost track of maddison before airborne polair officers found him holed up in his cabin during a 20hour siege police urged him to surrender 85 times.
Maddison fired at police and polair more than 20 times eventually trying to escape while still firing specialist police returned fire killing him.
The inquest is expected to investigate police operations and policies the interactions police had with maddison leading up to the siege management of the siege and the adequacy of internal investigations and their recommendation.
It will also investigate the lack of information shared between gatton and toowoomba police about the gatton investigation into reports of gunfire
Ms helsen recommended the inquests be heard jointly in two tranches to cover the evidence with 25 witnesses expected to be called.
Mr ryan agreed to reconsider a planned november inquest after lawyers for senior constable fortes widow susan said they had not had enough time to read through the 19700page brief of evidence.
Maddisons family told the court they did not intend to participate in the inquest process.
A date for the inquest is yet to be finalised.

Copyright © 2020Communities secretary says support package enough after northern leaders warn it is ‘Insufficient’ and will destroy communities.
Find your bookmarks in your independent premium section under my profile
The government has ruled out giving more support to workers and businesses hit by new lockdowns in the north of england because of concerns it would cost too much.
Communities secretary robert jenrick said on sunday that “the national debt is rising” and that “we can’t do everything” to protect all jobs.
He was responding to a warning by northern leaders on saturday that the support package unveiled by the government was “Insufficient.” and would see “communities plunged into hardship”
The mayors of greater manchester sheffield merseyside and tyneside said the scheme – which covers just twothirds of wages and only applies to some workers in specific sectors – would “level down the north of england and widen the northsouth divide”
But mr jenrick told sky news “we can’t do everything we’re in a deep recession the national debt is rising.
“I think most reasonable people would see that the chancellor’s put in place an unprecedented package of support.
“this is a good safety net for those individuals but we understand that it will be very difficult for them the winter is going to be a very challenging one and we can’t promise to protect every job or every business.
“we can promise to offer hope and opportunity to those individuals who want to or will need to look for new jobs and opportunities.”
The refusal to improve the support package for people hit by the lockdown comes amid disquiet on the conservative party’s right wing over the amount of public money being spent by the chancellor rishi sunak.
But proponents of extra support point out that public borrowing is currently effectively free because of negative interest rates making it a good time for the government to spend money.
The new scheme only pays twothirds of wages compared to 80 per cent on the previous furlough scheme and only covers businesses whose premises are forced to close by law rather than indirectly shut because of economic pressures labour estimates that the scheme will cover just 65 per cent of the jobs in restricted or shut down sectors.
Shadow work and pensions secretary jonathan reynolds said there was “anger and frustration” in his greater manchester constituency and across the north at the government’s approach and that “people think they’ve been treated with contempt and not with respect”
He said the government had squandered its opportunities to tackle the virus adding “the fact is there are going to have to be further measures and the reason for that is the government have lost control they’ve lost control of the messaging they’ve lost control of test and trace they’ve lost control of the virus unfortunately that means we are going to have to have further measures that wasn’t inevitable
“that time we got from the lockdown and the development of what should have been an effective test and trace system should have meant we have to get to that position but the crucial point is this further restrictions have to come with economic support.
“the situation for businesses here in my constituency is not acceptable how can they plan for next week they’ve had nine weeks of very restrictive local restrictions that has had a huge impact on them of course it has – and now we find out we will learn tomorrow what is going on the prime minister’s got to get a grip on this he’s got to come to parliament – but crucial any further restrictions have to come with extra support”
Mayor of greater manchester andy burnham had a similar stark message for the government.
“If you go ahead with this financial package in my view that will be to break what the government said it would do when they were elected” he told times radio.
“If they continue with this jobs will be lost businesses will collapse the fragile economies of the north will be shattered.

“the government has a real choice here if it proceeds on the path it is on in my view the central socalled mission of this government to levelup will be over”
But responding to criticism of the substance and style of the government’s announcement mr jenrick said “I think that is a very significant intervention it’s building on the winter economy plan that the chancellor had set out two weeks ago it was very well received it was supported by the tuc and the cbi
“as you say it ensures that those workers in businesses that are asked to close by law are then able to receive twothirds of their unearned wages we’re also providing those business grants to the small and medium sized businesses that need them”
He claimed that the government had worked closely with local leaders on the plan adding “I appreciate that people working in certain sectors and businesses owners will be feeling very concerned but we’ve set out i think a fair and generous package to support them we’ve spent the weekend working with those local leaders it’s not correct what you heard from jonathan reynolds that there hasn’t been good communication i’ve spent the whole weekend talking to leaders on merseyside and greater manchester from other parts of the country”
The government says it will not protect all jobs.

 costly errors and an inability to take advantage of houston’s mistakes gave the jacksonville jaguars another loss to a previously winless team on sunday and left them in last place in the afc south 
Deshaun watson threw for a seasonhigh 359 yards and three touchdowns and the texans got their first win of the season with a 30-14 victory in the wake of coach bill o’brien’s firing 
“we’ve got to look in the mirror reevaluate and just find a way to win” jaguars quarterback gardner minshew said 
Jacksonville has lost four straight since winning its opener and sunday’s loss made the jaguars the first team in nfl history to lose three straight games to previously winless teams not including season openers 
Sidney jones intercepted watson twice giving the jaguars a boost on a day they played without three defensive starters because of injuries but his big plays werent able to help much as jacksonville couldn’t convert either of the turnovers into points 
Stephen hauschka missed a 49-yard field goal on the last play of the first half after the first interception by jones that miss came after hauschka had missed from 24 yards with 37 seconds left in the second.
The texans led 137 after a field goal early in the third quarter and were driving later in the third when jones intercepted watson again he returned it 48 yards and would have likely scored if watson didn’t tackle him 
But the jaguars came away empty again as rookie running back james robinson fumbled after taking a direct snap on fourth down from the houston 10 and it was recovered by Jj watt 
“when you have a time where you have the situations like we’ve had especially after the turnovers or having the ball on the 2 or 3-yard line you’ve got turn those into points” jaguars coach doug marrone said “we weren’t able to do that that’s on all of us”
The jaguars also had a short field on the drive before watson’s second interception after a 40-yard kickoff return by keelan cole put them at their 40 but robinson was stopped for a loss on first down before minshew was sacked and then threw an incomplete pass to force a punt 
“the effort of how they’re playing is — i can’t ask for more” marrone said “now we can play smarter and we can make some plays yes and these are the things that we’re going to have to do and we’re going to have to go out and get ourselves a win because it stinks”
Minshew did some good things on sunday throwing for 30-1 yards and two touchdowns 
His second one came on a 4-yard pass to rookie collin johnson on fourthand4 to cut the lead to 2014 with about 10 minutes remaining chris conley had a 51-yard reception earlier in the drive to get the jaguars in scoring position.
The texans led 23-14 after a field goal with about 7½ minutes to go and got the ball back when jacob martin sacked minshew and forced a fumble it was recovered by whitney mercilus who fumbled on the return but the texans pounced on the ball to keep it 
Houston put the game away when watson found brandin cooks on a 28-yard touchdown pass on fourthand4 with about five minutes remaining 
While the jaguars had a good day in the passing game they struggled to run the ball houston entered the game allowing an nflworst 18-18 yards rushing a game but held jacksonville to just 75 with robinson managing only 48.
Now the jaguars are left searching for a way to get on track before they host the lions next sunday minshew was asked how they can do that and the quarterback didnt have any answers.
“we were actually just talking about that in the locker room trying to figure out what it is what’s missing because we have moments where we feel really good about it and we’ve just got to figure out how to be more consistent and keep moving forward” he said.

 teddy bridgewater threw for 313 yards and two touchdowns juston burris made a huge interception in the end zone and the carolina panthers held on for a 23-16 victory over the winless atlanta falcons on sunday perhaps finishing off the coaching career of atlantas dan quinn.
The falcons dropped to 05 for the first time since 1997 turning up the heat even more on their embattled coach 
Carolina 32 built a 207 halftime lead behind bridgewaters touchdown passes of 57 yards to Dj moore and 3 yards to mike davis drawing boos that could be heard even from a sparse socially distanced crowd of 6656 at 75000seat mercedesbenz stadium 
Atlanta which this season became the first team in nfl history to squander fourthquarter leads of at least 15 points in consecutive games tried to turn the script in the second half younghoe koo booted two field goals and the falcons drove into position for a tying score in the fourth quarter.
But on thirdand4 from the panthers 5 matt ryan badly underthrew a pass to russell gage in the back of the end zone allowing burris to make the interception with 849 remaining.
With the falcons clearly deflated carolina drove nearly the length of the field — taking 739 off the clock — to set up joey slyes third field goal of the game a 22-yarder with 110 remaining.
Atlanta settled for koos third field goal a 54-yarder with 4 seconds remaining in hopes of recovering an onside kick and getting one last shot at a tying hail mary but robby anderson fell on the high hopper to finish off the falcons.
The panthers won their third straight and snapped a fivegame losing streak to their nfc south rival beating atlanta for only the second time in their last 10 meetings.
Bridgewater was 27 of 37 in the eighth 300yard passing game of his career davis was a huge weapon rushing for 89 yards and hauling in nine catches for another 60 yards.
The falcons did plenty of damage on the ground rushing for 166 yards with a 66-yard average todd gurley led the way with 12-1 yards on 14 carries including a 35-yard td that gave atlanta an early 70 lead 
But ryan who didnt have top receiver julio jones was held to 21 of 37 for a seasonlow 226 yards.
This was the first game in which the falcons allowed fans though it was an extremely limited turnout that left plenty of room to spread out in the retractableroof stadium 
Trainers room.
Panthers de brian burns was knocked out of the game with a concussion after diving into a pile of tacklers late in the first half burns remained face down on the turf for several minutes before getting up slowly and wobbling to the sideline - carolina also lost two other defensive starters when cb donte jackson went out in the first quarter with a toe injury and tackle kawann short was ruled out late in the game with a shoulder injury - de yetur grossmatos ankle also left the game - og chris reed was evaluated for a possible concussion in the second quarter and cleared to return 
Falcons cb kendal sheffield who missed the first three games of the season with a foot injury left the field in the final minute of the first half with an injured right ankle sheffield was hurt while defending a pass along the sideline to anderson the carolina receiver went up to make a 22-yard catch while sheffield crumpled to the turf holding his foot - injury plagued de takk mckinley sustained a groin injury in the first quarter and did not return - jones couldnt go because of a lingering hamstring injury that has kept him off the field for all but one half in the last three games 
Up next.
Panthers host the chicago bears next sunday.
Falcons travel to minneapolis to face the minnesota vikings.

Secrets come out hippolyta is back and tic leti and montrose are headed back in time it’s the tulsa episode everyone this bit of history which was lost to most nonblack americans makes its second appearance on an hbo series once again the survivors are front and center and the endless trauma of black people in america remains the theme lovecraft country finally explores in depth how montrose became the man he is today in this powerfully moving episode 
Poor baby diana took the brunt of the hit with the police captain’s spell with her blood turned black and her skin shriveled up diana must fight to live long enough for tic leti and montrose to find a counter spell all the adults surrounding her quake with fear knowing the responsibility for the young girl’s suffering lays at their feet as they argue their secrets inch toward the surface leti’s pregnancy and montrose’s parietal accuracy remain hidden but ruby reveals her intrepid affair with christina she promises christina will perform the spell to heal diana unfortunately only the police captain who cast the spell can lift the curse the captain’s spell first turned diana into the physical manifestation of a Jigga boo then caused her to flesh to rot and fester from the inside out.
Luckily the hellhounds didn’t kill the captain in last week’s attack which leti spun as a gas explosion—but to call him alive and well would be false we learned that the police force kidnapped black citizens and hacked off whatever limbs an officer needed attaching the black body part to the white officer with magic christina sentenced william to a thousand deaths by overriding this quickfix spell but that line of deaths must end for the officer as christina did promise ruby she would slow the spell’s progress christina takes particular joy in watching the final death mask wash over the captain’s face.
9
Leti and ruby finally have the conversation they’ve needed to have for weeks ruby reveals that she believes montrose and tic to be violent men—not an unfounded thought considering how quickly those two go to blows of course leti knows christina she knows christina intends to kill tic and uses ruby to get closer to tic’s blood both sisters go their own way but each takes the lesson of the other.
Watching ruby call out christina brought a particular joy and relief to their relationship for so long i couldn’t tell who was playing who christina always seemed to possess the upper hand and yet she could never pin ruby down now that christina confesses what she wants magic for their attraction makes more sense christina gave ruby the ability to go places she’d never gone before it’s the same wish the young braithwaite held for herself using magic as a key no corner of the universe would be off limits to her the desire to control the world belonged to her father like ruby christina just wanted to escape the box built around her identity ruby understood and so made two crucial decisions first she demanded christina promise not hurt leti then she killed off her hillary proclaiming her white identity a red head i guess it’s hunting season for ruby red.
Hippolyta returns a new woman no longer timid she stands bone straight ready to tackle whatever event befell her daughter hippolyta’s been on earth 504 for 200 years calling herself whatever she damn well pleases as everyone questions her she straightens her crown and walks into fire a goddess reborn of earth and water hippolyta molded herself into a champion she plans to go back to the multidimensional machine to retrieve the book of names from the tulsa massacre 
Down at the conservatory in kentucky leti gets up the nerve to tell montrose she’s pregnant montrose reveals the gender of the baby and blames leti for the probable death of his son tic hippolyta turns herself into a motherboard with over six trillion alternate realities she needs to direct the computer to open a portal to this earth’s tulsa in 1921 while the process looks painful hippolyta doesn’t hesitate or falter but montrose does he’s entering the nightmare of his own past the reality he spent three decades drinking away confronting that reality—not just the severity of his father but the horrendous acts of terrorism inflicted upon the community—is the biggest step he’s taken in his life.
 the trio hop through the portal and realize that they only have a few hours before the attack begun time travel rules apply they can’t do anything that changes the future despite knowing that tic’s mother’s entire family would be burned alive in their home along with the book.
The secret montrose kept from tic his whole life finally comes to the surface the news hits atticus like a ton of bricks all the beatings montrose made him endure all the time he spent with george wishing he could call him dad—and now he lives with an unknown who really sired him 
Tic snaps when he realizes montrose came to the past high on liquid courage and he tells him all the hateful things he’s stored in his heart since he was a child finally tic decides to end his relationship with his father after they’ve saved d’s life the reality of the harm done combined with his worst fears staring him in the face brings montrose to a halt montrose watches his younger self being beaten with a lengthy branch by his drunk and enraged father homophobia that causes the beating to extend until montrose cannot stand we see what the love between montrose george and tic’s mother meant dora tic’s mom protected montrose loved him like a brother and she couldn’t stand the way george stood by and watched montrose be beaten she used her life to stand in between montrose and the cruel world.
Of course montrose has just now discovered the hero within he takes off leti and tic think he went to warn his older brother about the impending terrorist attack so they decide to split up leti though invincible finds herself being chased down by an angry white mob she runs into dora’s house for shelter the entire house flies into a panic rounding up their weapons and searching for the kids 
Leti agrees to help protect the house—shooting first to warn and then to kill hannah immediately something wasn’t right with the new girl the tennis shoes gave her away as the house burns down around them hannah has to choose whether to save her family from burning or accept her fate and help her descendant by giving up the book of names she chooses to help leti she binds the book in a spell allowing future users to only use the book for welfare and not evil “when my greatgreat grandson is born he will be my faith turned flesh” hannah blesses leti as the upstairs begins to spark and crackle with flames we cannot hear our ancestors proclaim us as their wildest dream and as a descendant of slaves i found power in hannah’s proclamation truly this is what art is for.
Hannah turns out to be a woman of god she asks leti to pray the “our father prayer” with her their words drown under the poem “catch the fire” by sonia sanchez posted below as the house burns they gripped hands the love passion and knowledge passes like fire from one mother to the next as white men cackle while the life built for them burns around them leti continues to hold hannah’s hand even as she burns and screams in agony the past is never dead and we cannot outrun the tragedy inflicted upon our ancestors but we can become less vulnerable to the attacks and we can honor those who survived long enough so that we might exist we are tribute to the lives they might have led were they truly free 
Sometimes i wonder.

In the soft afternoon air as you
Hold us all in a single death.
I say—

The fire of blackness…not gangster shadows.
Where is our beautiful fire that gave light.
To the world.
The fire of pyramids.
The fire that burned through the holes of
Slaveships and made us breathe
The fire that made guts into chitterlings.
The fire that took rhythms and made jazz
The fire of sitins and marches that made
Us jump boundaries and barriers.
The fire that took street talk sounds.
And made righteous imhotep raps.
Where is your fire the torch of life.
Full of nzingha and nat turner and garvey.
And dubois and fannie lou hamer and martin
And malcolm and mandela.

Montrose did not go to warn his brother he left to save his first love thomas and this is where we learn that it wasn’t the beatings that destroyed montrose but the loss of his first love he stopped saying thomas’ name so that he could have a chance at a life this is the pain he ran from he referred to the loss of this love “as the first in a long line of sacrifices.” he made to be tic’s father tic like all children forgot his father only existed as flesh and blood while none of montrose’s pain makes up for what he put tic through it does explain how he ended up so lost how he could cavalierly say the murder of children are the lesson all black folks must learn.
For montrose murder isn’t a possibility but a stark eventuality if that reality is not accepted it will bring a person to their knees this knowledge weighs so heavy on the spirit that it literally kills the victim it takes years but it destroys completely i think of eric garner’s namesake erica garner who after watching her father be murdered by the police became an activist before dying of a heart attack at just 27 i think about the pockets of black dominated spaces laced with poverty throughout america where the average life span of a citizen is just 26 years 
Montrose lived too long at the precipice of destruction he befriended it and courted it until he became as close as lovers with the idea of destruction he could no longer see the difference between himself and the destruction he caused it seemed to him an inevitability that he would become his father he couldn’t see he was making a choice to become his dad all of it all of it came from the seed of knowledge that in america black lives don’t matter.
When george faces the person he hid from himself the little boy who deserved love instead of beatings the teenager who deserved romantic love and the man who desperately wanted to be a father he can admit to his son that every sacrifice was worth it because it ended in the existence of tic by this logic montrose believed he could save thomas without sacrificing the son he loves so much he held onto that ideal for as long as he could willing it to be true but in the end montrose was unwilling to take the risk he relied on his personal cavalry his future wife and his brother to save him as he narrates the atrocities he survived sometimes the only way to heal is to speak he talks out his trauma with the one person there to witness it and little by little the pain clenching his heart eases but does not dissipate
Tic and atticus realize at the same time that tic was the mysterious stranger the person who had their back the future that made their wildest dreams come true it’s a beautiful full circle moment for the father and son who have struggled to understand one another just like the book never burned in the house tic was always meant to be montrose’s savior it’s not the right way of things a child should not have to protect a parent but parents are only human and do occasionally require a hero there can be such beauty in forgiveness in releasing and healing the pain done to us over and over again montrose had such a wall of pain humiliation and isolation to climb it makes horrible sense that a new generation would need to come around before he could heal all the wounds inflicted upon him.
Montrose relived his childhood horror from the hotel naming the neighbors icons and children whose destinies were not yet known hippolyta struggles to keep the portal open as leti walks painfully slowly through bombs that seem as if they were dropped on her specifically and montrose stares out the window hippolyta’s hair turns blue orynthia blue for her troubles becoming the hero her daughter always believed she could be “rewind 1921” ends with all the cards on the table the autumnal equinox follows next week will tic survive tune in next week to find out.
Stray observations 
A contributor for playboy and hollywood reporter joelle writes about film television and comic books a speaker host and avid podcaster her reviews have been featured on npr BBc1 and et.Wa health minister roger cook says australian mining companies have agreed to no longer use manilabased ship crew members after the state confirmed an outbreak of covid-19 on board the vega dream iron ore bulk carrier currently anchored off the port hedland coast.
The vega dream is the second ship that has arrived in northern wa with positive cases on board in recent months.
There has been an outbreak on board the vega dreamcreditmarine traffic.
Mr cook said a situation where bulk carrier crew members were bringing coronavirus infections on board a vessel and then incubating the illness on its way to australia was unacceptable
One crew member who tested positive before others were tested was transferred to hedland hospital and is in a covidsafe ward tests have been carried out and of the ships remaining 19 crew members six tested positive mr cook revealed.
They are all on the vessel at anchor 22 nautical miles off shore
We understand theyre in good spirits mr cook said.
And there have been no reports of them being unwell what i can stress is that there is no risk i repeat no risk to the port hedland community.
There had been concern in port hedland that a marine pilot and cargo surveyor who went on board the ship might have posed a transmission risk.
But mr cook said neither had been in close contact with any of the crew that have since tested positive and have no symptoms they are selfisolating as a precaution.
We do understand there is a level of anxiety in the community and for that reason we are isolating the pilot he said.
The vega dream left the port about 530pm on sunday fully laden with iron ore the positive crew members are isolating on board in rooms with ensuites.
The ship is now outside wa jurisdiction but mr cook said the state government continued to engage with what was happening on board and was working with the federal government which will decide the next steps.
Another ore carrier the patricia oldendorff arrived at port hedland in september bringing with it an outbreak that necessitated the evacuation of the crew to quarantine at the hedland hotel was department of health declared that ships outbreak over on saturday and it set sail for its next destination on sunday.
About 30 per cent of the crews which sail to the pilbara are based in manila.
Chamber of minerals and energy wa chief executive paul everingham said its members had been talking to shipping agents about sourcing crews from other countries but it would take some time as new arrangements were made
There was another case of covid-19 recorded overnight a man in his 50s who travelled to wa from indonesia he is in hotel quarantine.

Switzerland’s foreign ministry says a swiss woman held hostage in mali since 2016 has been killed by an armed group affiliated to alqaeda.
The ministry on friday said it was informed by the french authorities that the hostage had been “Killed by kidnappers of the islamist terrorist organisation jama’at nusrat alislam muslimeen” Jnim about a month ago.
The Jnim is considered mali’s branch of alqaeda armed group.
Switzerland’s foreign minister condemned the killing of stoeckli whose release his country had quietly been trying to negotiate since she was kidnapped four years ago.
“It was with great sadness that i learned of the death of our fellow citizen” ignazio cassis said in a statement “I condemn this cruel act and express my deepest sympathy to the relatives.”
Cassis said the exact circumstances of her killing were still unclear.
“the information about the killing was obtained by the french authorities from the recently released french hostage” the ministry said adding that it was trying to find out more about the circumstances of stoeckli’s killing and the whereabouts of her remains.
Earlier this week french aid worker sophie petronin italians reverend pierluigi maccalli and nicola chiacchio and prominent malian politician soumaila cisse were released days after the malian government freed nearly 200 fighters in an apparent prisoner exchange.
Stoeckli a christian missionary and at least four other foreign hostages were held by the Jnim and its associates the fate of the others was not immediately known.

Barbara hart asks why are northern new south wales local areas excluded from the queenslandnsw bubble zone that have been covid-19 free since april for example armidale regional council that abuts glen innes shire why not exclude queensland entry to only people living or working in postcodes with covid-19 cases in the last 28 days and who cannot travel through covid-19 free zones to queensland my husband and i are queenslanders working in northern nsw who need to come home for medical appointments in early november under the current rules we would have to go into hotel quarantine.
Police checks at the queenslandnsw border checkpoint at nerangcreditelise derwin
A queensland health spokeswoman answers these are difficult decisions however these restrictions are in place for the protection of queenslanders.
We understand there will be some communities close to but not immediately neighbouring the border that won’t fall into these border communities and maybe inconvenienced by these restrictions.
The border zone decision balances the health and safety of queenslanders with preventing the need to put back in place more restrictions.
The border zone was decided based on the location of key services for border towns this includes both sides of the border – people who live in queensland but work or go to school in their neighbouring border town or people who live in new south wales but come to work or school in their neighbouring border town in queensland.
A reader name not supplied asks has nsw premier gladys berejiklian got any financial interests in tourist companies in queensland what is nsws ongoing interest in queenslands border policy really about given the lnp appear to have to same policy as the premier why does the nsw premier just attack the caretaker premier why isnt this daily barrage from nsw considered an interference in queensland affairs and indeed in an open election campaign.
Nsw premier gladys berejiklian does not have any interests in queensland tourism venturescreditnick moir.
Brisbane times pm editor cameron atfield answers to borrow a phrase im going to have to take a lot of that as a comment.
However i can address the question as to whether gladys berejiklian has any financial interests in queensland tourism the answer according to her parliamentary interests disclosure is no.
But i can tell you it took me a very long time to get this answer finding the disclosure file on the nsw government website is like finding a needle in a haystack then when you finally find the pdf it is not searchable so you have to scroll through hundreds of pages to find what youre after.
Anyway if youre interested in having a look yourself ms berejiklians return can be seen here on page 170 now excuse me while i put my scrolling finger on ice.
Nick asks how many seats could the green party win at the next election i know there are a few tight races.
Brisbane times pm editor cameron atfield answers the greens are often bullish about their chances but i do know they are targeting three seats in particular — maiwar which is already held by the greens and the laborheld south brisbane and mcconnel.
The greens are targeting innercity brisbane seatscreditglenn hunt.
As for their chances in those seats i will defer to the experts
Queensland university of technology political analyst former labor government minister and former speaker john mickel answers the greens have always overinflated their chances.
Their best chances are in retaining maiwar winning south brisbane off the back of lnp preferences and in mcconnel possibly from labor preferences if the greens overwhelm labor in that seat or from lnp preferences if the lnp is relegated to third place.
The greens poll well in lnpheld moggill and clayfield but not enough to win
In the absence of public polls my best guess is the retention of maiwar.
Griffith university political expert paul williams answers - goodness could technically every seat they contest as is the case for every party.
Likely to win two — maiwar and south brisbane.
If the lnp runs third in mcconnel and enough lnp voters want to dump grace grace mcconnel is also an outside chance.
A reader name not supplied asks why is it that queensland hasnt yet produced a budget this year was it because the state budget couldnt be produced until the federal budget was finalised which didnt happen until after the caretaker period started.

Prime minister scott morrison postponed handing down the federal budget until october 6 because of the pandemic and states followed suit october 6 also happened to be the same day the queensland government entered the caretaker period.
The government released a “Minibudget” in september instead which forecast debt deficit and other economic indicators such as unemployment and economic growth.
Treasurer cameron dick has promised a full budget would be delivered by the end of november if labor retains government opposition leader deb frecklington has committed to releasing a full budget by early february if elected.
Here are how other states have timed their budgets
Mr dick said “In a year of such volatility states have rightly waited to see the federal budget and its impact on revenues before delivering their own budgets”
Ms frecklington said “If you don’t have a budget you don’t have a plan”
A reader name not supplied asks will the lnp if elected sell electricity assets to pay for their promises.
Brisbane times state political reporter lydia lynch answers both major parties have ruled out selling governmentowned assets to save the state from plunging into further debT.

The lnp went to the 2015 election with a 37 billion asset sales program following a 14 billion program by the former bligh government.
When asked if an lnp government would sell assets opposition leader deb frecklington replied “no”
Premier annastacia palaszczuk said we have absolutely guaranteed to the people of this state that our electricity assets are not for sale”
Her treasurer cameron dick later clarified that meant all state owned assets including water and ports
“queenslanders have made it very clear they do not want public assets sold or leased so our government will not be selling public assets”
Queensland’s total debt including governmentowned businesses will balloon to 102 billion by june 2021 up from the 838 million forecast in december as the government is forced to borrow to fund infrastructure projects
Dk asks who is likely to lead labor should they lose the election.
Brisbane times pm editor cameron atfield answers this is a question to which there is no clearcut answer it should also be answered in the context that queensland labor has not had a contested leadership ballot since the joh era.
Unlike the lnp which decides its parliamentary leader through a party room vote of elected mps labor has a more complicated process and its a process we have yet to see in action since it became party policy in 2013.
Annastacia palaszczuk has been labor leader since 2012 cameron dick in the background would be a leading contender to replace her should labor losecredit-jono searlegetty images.
Assuming there is a leadership vacancy which there automatically would be in the event of an election loss and it is contested then those candidates would need to appeal not only to their caucus colleagues but to affiliated unions and rankandfile labor party members as well.
Each of those three voting blocs will have an equal say in who will be the parliamentary leader of the alp so while the left faction has the biggest voting bloc within caucus that would not necessarily be played out by other stakeholders votes.
All that said the obvious contenders from the current crop would be from the right cameron dick and stirling hinchliffe from the old guard faction curtis pitt and grace grace and from the left deputy premier steven miles mark bailey or if you want a dark horse someone like shannon fentiman
James asks im confused about the full preferential voting system can you vote for only one candidate in the queensland state election and still have your vote counted as a formal vote there are candidates in my electorate that i do not wish to support under any circumstances and i would prefer not to give them any preference at all in my vote
Brisbane times pm editor cameron atfield answers with fpv all boxes must be numbered for your vote to count otherwise your ballot will be considered an informal vote
Voters will have to number every box on their ballot papercreditafr.
While not everybody agrees with fpv i think its the most democratic system in the world in firstpastthepost elections the candidate with most votes wins sounds fair enough right well it does as long as that candidate received a majority of the vote if that firstpastthepost winner received less than half the vote it becomes quite problematic.
Imagine youre in an electorate where theres one antiice cream candidate and three proice cream candidates the ice cream vote would effectively be split in three meaning the antiice cream candidate could be elected with say 30 per cent of the vote you can see how easy it becomes for an electorate to be represented by somebody with a diametrically opposed view to the majority of voters and now you cant even inhale a tub of chocchip to commiserate
Another system used in many countries is the runoff election if no candidate receives a majority of votes 50 per cent plus one then another election is held but this time with just the top two candidates vying off against each other fpv effectively makes this an automatic process without the need to go back to the polls to sort it out.
Its important to remember that your preference flow would never reach the undesirable candidates in your electorate if one of the last two candidates standing is numbered ahead of them.
Gabriel devine asks how likely is it that the greens could retain maiwar this election.
Griffith university political expert paul williams answers very likely.
Labor will run third and preference greens over lnp.
Maiwars michael berkman goes into this election as the greens sole mp in the queensland parliament.
Sven asks why are some electorates named after people and not the area the location of the seat of caloundra is clear to everybody but who knows where oodgeroo or mcconnell is located.
An electoral commission of queensland spokeswoman answers this brisbane times article may be helpful.
Acclaimed poet oodgeroo noonuccal pictured in 1980 photograph used with the permission of the quandamooka peoplecreditarchives.
Naming an electorate after an area can be problematic because if there’s a redistribution the new electorate boundaries may no longer reflect a single place.
For example oodgeroo takes in north stradbroke island and parts of cleveland.
Electorate boundaries can be explored here just put in an address in the search box and the map will be opened.
Glenn d amezdroz asks amy macmahon has a large billboard near the gabba displaying a slogan that the greens dont access funding from large corporations can this be factchecked please where do the greens get their funding.
Brisbane times pm editor cameron atfield answers according to electoral commission of queensland disclosures the biggest single contributor to the queensland greens over the past four years has been reclusive mathematician and professional punter duncan turpie who has forked out at least 200000.

The secondbiggest contributor to the queensland greens is the australian greens they have sent more than 200000 north in the past four years so did the national body accept any corporate dollars not directly according to australian electoral commission disclosures with most money coming from various state branches.
Another notable donor is wotif founder graeme wood who contributed 40000 in 2017.
The rest of the partys donations are relatively small coming from individuals rather than corporations.

I have it why not hive off a bit of the iconic bondi beach for the exclusive use of the rich well how funny i should say that because such is the precise proposal put forward by a mob called amalfi beach club which wants to have a european style “beach club” on the sands this summer as the exclusive preserve of those who can afford to pay for it oh yes they can have “prebooked beach cabanas accompanied by personal service” waverley council is about to consider it.
I say no no no and a thousand times no.
Bondi beach is for everyonecreditedwina pickles.
Do that and you mark a stain on the very fabric of the country i say that a good chunk of the joy of the joint is that no matter who we are what we do what our living circumstances are there is – at least at our best – an essential assumption of equality between us all and there is no better example of our egalitarian nature than summer on the beach when as the sun beats down and the waves pound in you have butcher baker candlestick maker rich man poor man beggar man thief judges criminals matrons madonnas young old black white gay straight fit infirm all frolicking in the froth and lying on towels side by side with no one giving a damn about anything much and certainly not who has the best car back in the carpark.
Stop that on bondi beach of all places and say “no this part of the beach is for the rich only and you poor folk can’t lie here” bloody well no.
It was the australian presenter on cnn john vause who put it best of all this week “there are more cases of covid-19 in the white house - than nz taiwan and vietnam combined” bingo.
Going into this election let all those who defend trump’s abilities and most particularly his skills and leadership in reducing the impact of covid on his country answer that in those three aforementioned countries you had serious leadership embracing shortterm pain for longterm gain – rather like dan andrews in victoria come to think of it – and the result is three countries that got entirely on top of it and on the other hand you had trump’s america where despite understanding the gravity of the situation in february he denied the seriousness set a terrible example and actively encouraged the people not to wear masks he mocked those governors who tried to restrict movement and talked of “liberating” states like michigan where the leadership had wisely imposed the beginnings of lockdown.
And there you have the result in part apparently thanks to holding an event in the rose garden to announce the supreme court nominee where just about no measures of social distance were observed and few masks worn it looks to have turned into a “superspreader” event with multiple attendees now infected at least 36 people in the presidents orbit have tested positive.
Protecting america against the plague please the fact that president trump couldn’t even keep it out of the white house nor even out of the oval office says it all.
Replay.

Idly wondering on thursday if one line often used by kamala harris in her strong vicepresidential debate performance “I will not be lectured on law enforcement by the vice president.” might have been inspired by julia gillard’s globally famous words to tony abbott “I will not be lectured on misogyny by this man i asked our former pm if she saw it like that too.
Alas - “I have to confess” she told me “I have been on beyond blue work today and haven’t seen the debate i will catch up with it but i am always happy to see a woman use a ‘I won’t be lectured’ line”
Ms gillard also drew my attention to a social media campaign called wehaveherback i had not been aware of calling out sexist and racist commentary in the election.
Basically online people are calling out anything racist or sexist towards ms harris with that tagline.
Kamala harris seemed to borrow a line from australia in her debate with mike pence creditap.
In an amazing concurrence boris johnson vladimir putin and donald trump drop dead with a heart attack at exactly the same moment an instant later they are at the pearly gates where saint peter ushers them into the presence of the lord himself.
“gentlemen” says the lord “I have had a gutful the world is a complete mess and it cannot go on one week from today the world will end in a minute from now you will be resuscitated and i ask you to call a press conference shortly thereafter to tell the world the news so they can prepare themselves.”
And yea verily it came to pass.
One minute later boris johnson comes to flat on his back at 10 downing street as staff pound his chest and that evening addresses the nation.
“I have good news and i have bad news the good news is that god exists i have met him and he is a great man the bad news alas is that the world will end a week from tonight because the lord is no longer prepared to put up with what we humans have done with our life on earth thank you and good night”
Ditto vladimir putin after being revived he addresses the russian people “patriots good news and bad news have i good news despite a century of communist denial the lord exists bad news god’s had a gutful the world will end one week from tonight this is all’
And now it is donald trump’s “I have good news” he tells the american people and i have tremendous news the good news is that i have met the lord in heaven yes i have met him and he exists but the tremendous news really tremendous is that i will not lose the coming election”
“Make america actively not on fire again”  Jim carrey playing joe biden introducing his new campaign slogan in a skit for the opener of the season for saturday night live.
“full marks for balls malone i wouldn’t have taken the risk to not have alan jones but the alan jones factor there wasn’t one they can be very very happy with that”  john singleton former owner of 2gb congratulating nine radios chief tom malone on his decision to part ways with jones.
“this is insanity every single person in the vehicle during that completely unnecessary presidential ‘Driveby’ just now has to be quarantined for 14 days they might get sick they may die for political theatre commanded by trump to put their lives at risk for theatre”  dr james p phillips attending physician at walter reed hospital after trump briefly left hospital so he could wave at supporters from a car.
“It’s unexplainable that donald trump actively shedding virus – millions of particles – could walk into that building unmasked with that number of white house staff”  jonathan reiner professor of medicine at george washington university after trump headed back to the white house while covidpositive.
“there’s still no vision for the future”  shadow minister for finance Jim chalmers about the budget.
“one of the indicia of a successful judiciary is its anonymity in australia other than lawyers there would be very few who could tell you the names of the seven justices of the high court one of the reasons for that is that there is an implicit and deeply grained public assumption - that the courts the judges are the neutral umpires and not the protagonists i cant help but compare that virtuous state of affairs with the debate you get in the united states – as were seeing at the moment – about the appointment of judges to their highest court”  former attorneygeneral george brandis saying that the fight over ruth bader ginsburgs seat on the us supreme court should serve as a cautionary tale to australian lawyers and activists who want judges to have a greater role in ethical and political decisions.
“what we want is for people to live fearlessly but with common sense”  british prime minister boris johnson’s latest solution for covid-19.
“there’s no more waiting climate change is actually happening now”  dr sebastian pfautsch a senior lecturer in urban studies at the school of social sciences at wsu said the findings of his research showed the effects of climate change were already apparent as sydneys hottest area reached temperatures above 50 degrees across several locations on three separate days last summer.
“I feel great i feel like perfect i think this was a blessing from god that i caught it this was a blessing in disguise”  president trump on catching covid-19 the lord – he moves in mysterious ways.

Copyright © 2020Thousands of participants in the sunherald city2surf will run throughout sydney next weekend prompting authorities to remind motorists about the expected influx of pedestrians near popular exercise tracks.
The pandemic will prevent the worlds largest fun run taking place on its usual route winding from the cbd to bondi beach but the first virtual event allows runners joggers and walkers to choose their own course
City2surf runners make their way along william street during the 2019 event this year runners will take part in a virtual event creditbrook mitchell.
Authorities are warning motorists to be cautious of runners darting in front of cars or crowding pedestrian crossings.
Participants are banned from running the usual course from hyde park to the eastern suburbs and will be disqualified if they take that route or if they finish at bondi park or queen elizabeth drive.
The virtual event means participants can complete their walk or run anytime from 6am friday to 6pm sunday.
There will be none of the typical road closures and this years event rules require more than 7000 people registered for the event to stay off the citys roads and stick to footpaths or nature strips.
Sydneysiders have been warned popular walking and running tracks such as the bay run loop in the inner west might be more crowded than usual next weekend creditsteven siewert.
Transport for nsw chief operations officer howard collins said parking around popular running tracks could get busy so participants should allow additional travel time and be extra careful.
We do not want people running on the road where there is a footpath or nature strip or darting out in front of vehicles when crossing roads.
Please ditch any unnecessary distractions look left and right and check twice for trams or other vehicles when crossing the road make sure you look out before you step or run out.
Mr collins said participants who were considering completing the course on a popular track were encouraged to start early in the morning to avoid the larger midmorning and lunch time crowds.
Motorists are also warned there might be an increase in the number of pedestrians running near roads along footpaths and crossing roads and driveways between 6am and 6pm next sunday.
If you are participating in this year’s event please remember to stay on designated footpaths and walkways use designated crossings where available and if you are driving that day be mindful of the extra pedestrians who will be out and about.
Mr collins strongly urged any participants who planned on using public transport on the day to wear a mask and maintain physical distancing.
Crowds on popular exercise routes in sydney including the bondi to bronte coastal track and the bay run loop were a focus for health and local council authorities encouraging compliance with physical distancing measures during the height of the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year.
Entries are open now for the sunherald city2surf which will be held on october 18.

Some notable quotes from supreme court nominee amy coney barrett a former notre dame law professor and current judge on the chicagobased 7th us circuit court of appeals her confirmation hearings begin monday at the senate judiciary committee to fill the seat left vacant by the death of justice ruth bader ginsburg.

On judicial nominees.
“however cagey a justice may be at the nomination stage her approach to the constitution becomes evident in the opinions she writes - it would be difficult for a modern justice to avoid revealing her position on whether the original public meaning of the constitution controls its interpretation” — 2013 article in the texas law review.

“we shouldn’t be putting people on the court that share our policy preferences we should be putting people on the court who want to apply the constitution” — 2016 speech at jacksonville university’s public policy institute

On abortion.
“If anything the public response to controversial cases like roe v wade reflects public rejection of the proposition that precedent can declare a permanent victor in a divisive constitutional struggle rather than desire that precedent remain forever unchanging court watchers embrace the possibility of overruling even if they may want it to be the exception rather than the rule” — 2013 article in the texas law review citing roe v wade the 1973 landmark ruling that recognized a woman’s right to abortion 
Already have an account log in here

“I think it is very unlikely at this point that the court is going to overturn roe v wade - the fundamental element that the woman has a right to choose abortion will probably stand” — 2013 lecture at notre dame on the 40-th anniversary of the roe ruling.

“I don’t think abortion or the right to abortion would change i think some of the restrictions would change - the question is how much freedom the court is willing to let states have in regulating abortion” — 2016 remarks on how a conservative supreme court could alter current law on abortion saying it wasn’t likely to try and overturn roe she said the questions the high court would be willing to address would be states’ restrictions on abortions including how abortion clinics operate

On faith and politics.
“catholic judges are obliged by oath professional commitment and the demands of citizenship to enforce the death penalty they are also obliged to adhere to their church’s teaching on moral matters.” — 1998 article cowritten by barrett in the marquette law review on how some catholic judges would feel torn on certain legal questions because of the teachings of their faith.

“If you’re asking whether i take my faith seriously and i’m a faithful catholic — i am although i would stress that my personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear in the discharge of my duties as a judge” — confirmation hearing in 2017 before the senate judiciary committee considering her nomination for the appeals court after sen dick durbin dill asked her if she was orthodox catholic.

“never it’s never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge’s personal convictions whether they derive from faith or anywhere else on the law” — 2017 senate hearing.

“I totally reject and i have rejected throughout my entire career the proposition that as you say the end justifies the means or that a judge should decide cases based on a desire to reach a certain outcome” — 2017 senate hearing.

“I would decide cases according to rule of law beginning to end and in the rare circumstance that might ever arise — i can’t imagine one sitting here now — where i felt that i had some conscientious objection to the law i would recuse i would never impose my own personal convictions upon the law — 2017 senate hearing.

“I can’t think of any cases or category of cases in which i would feel obliged to recuse on the grounds of conscience” — 2017 senate hearing.

“a judge may never subvert the law or twist it in any way to match the judge’s convictions from whatever source they derive” — 2017 senate hearing.

On precedent.
“In the supreme court adhering to precedent is a soft rule the court describes it as one of policy rather than as an ‘Inexorable command’” — 2013 article in the texas law review.

“leaving room for new majorities to overrule old ones allows changed membership to change what the court says the constitution means.” — texas law review.

“If the court’s opinions change with its membership public confidence in the court as an institution might decline its members might be seen as partisan rather than impartial and case law as fueled by power rather than reason” — texas law review.

A justice must “think carefully about whether she is sure enough about her rationale for overruling to pay the cost of upsetting institutional investment in the prior approach if she is not sure enough the preference for continuity trumps” — texas law review.

“Institutional features of supreme court practice permit all justices to let some sleeping dogs lie and so far as we are aware no one has ever argued that a justice is dutybound to wake them up” — 2017 article cowritten by barrett in the university of pennsylvania journal of constitutional law arguing there often are pragmatic reasons not to attempt to overturn precedents even if a justice is convinced they were wrongly decided.

Updated 823am 13 oct 2020Phoenix - roberta wright mccain the mother of the late sen john mccain who used her feisty spirit to help woo voters during his 2008 presidential campaign has died she was 108.
A spokesperson for daughterinlaw cindy mccain says roberta mccain died monday a cause of death was not immediately released.
“It is with great sadness that i announce the death of my wonderful mother inlaw roberta mccain” cindy mccain -        posted on twitter “I couldn’t have asked for a better role model or a better friend”
In a         tweet granddaughter meghan mccain thanked her “nana” for teaching her how to live life with “Grit conviction intensity and love”
“there will never be another one like you you will be missed every day i wish my daughter had gotten to meet you” said mccain who gave birth to her first child last month.
At 96 roberta mccain became the republican senator’s secret weapon at campaign stops as evidence that voters need not worry about her son’s age — then past 70 — as he sought the presidency.
She once said her son liked to hold her up as an example of “what he hopes his lifespan will be”
In august 2018 however it was the mother who ended up mourning the son when john mccain died of brain cancer despite being slowed by a stroke roberta mccain attended the memorial and burial services in washington and maryland for the middle son she called “johnny”
She remained energetic and active into her 90s traveling often with her identical twin sister rowena who died at age 99 she attended the 2008 republican national convention where her son credited “her love of life her deep interest in the world her strength and her belief we are all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our country.
It was 1933 when a 20-yearold roberta wright defied her family and eloped with john mccain Jr. documents released in 2008 showed that as a young ensign john Jr. got into trouble when the couple decided to marry and he left his ship without permission.
“I got married young” she told the muskogee phoenix in her native oklahoma in 2008 “I was 20 years old and it was the best decision i ever made”
She married into a storied military family — her husband retired in 1972 with the rank of fourstar admiral the same rank held by his father john s “slew” mccain sr her son was held as a prisonerofwar in vietnam even as his father was commander in chief of pacific forces in the late 1960s.
Roberta mccain was a young woman when her three children were born later telling the oklahoma paper that she was “too young and irresponsible to know you were supposed to worry about them i just let them go i got a kick out of watching them”
The senator said in 2008 that his “father was often at sea and the job of raising my brother sister and me would fall to my mother alone”
Her other son joe told the associated press in 2007 that the family had endless dinnertable discussions about history politics and legislation led by their mother.
“we were all basically on the same side of the fence” joe mccain said “but it was like talmudic scholars arguing about a single word or an adjective in the testament.”
Joe mccain was at his mothers side at her washington home when she died         according to a statement from cindy mccain roberta mccains daughter jean mccain died last year.
When sen john mccain wrote a memoir about his experience as a pow for nearly six years in a north vietnamese prison he described times when he swore in english at his vietnamese guards who didn’t understand.
His mother later told him “johnny i’m going to come over there and wash your mouth out with soap”
Meghan mccain recalled her grandmothers strong will and sense of duty in a 2012 column for the daily beast website writing that roberta mccain did not have “a lot of patience for excuses especially from my father when he was growing up and acting out”
“she once hit him over the head with a thermos in the back of a car because he was acting up so badly on a road trip” meghan mccain wrote
The mccain matriarch’s spunky personality became the stuff of stories for the family — and among those in their circle of washington society.
“last christmas she wanted to drive around france so she flew to paris and tried to rent a car” the senator once joked “they said she was too old so she bought one and drove around france”
Cindy mccain wrote monday that “Roberta was the liveliest presence in every room she graced an irresistible force of nature”
Roberta wright was born feb 7 19-12 in muskogee oklahoma where her father was a businessman whose varied colorful enterprises included bootlegging and oil wildcatting the family moved to los angeles in the mid-1920s.
Her husband commanded submarines in world war ii and was second in command of the cruiser st paul during the korean war he later held key posts including the navy’s chief of congressional liaison and died in 1981.
In 1934 when a fitness report deemed him underweight the future admiral wrote “my wife doesn’t know how to cook and my meals are very irregular”

247 coverage of breaking news and live eventsAcademics are warning not to expect results of the us election immediately after the 3 november vote
Find your bookmarks in your independent premium section under my profile
The night of tuesday november 3 was always going to be memorable with those who love donald trump and those who hate him glued to their television sets
But it has now become apparent that this will really be an election unlike any ever before - because we may not know the results for some time. 
Why might there be delays.
The 2016 election was called for trump at about 0230 est 0730 gmt after victory in wisconsin put him over the 270 electoral votes needed this year will be very different.
An unprecedented number of americans - 80 million twice the number from 2016 - are expected to vote by mail given coronavirus concerns and some states will count ballots that are delivered after the election if they are postmarked by a deadline.
Furthermore pandemic precautions may well cause long lines at polling stations because fewer people will be allowed in at a time ballot counters will be restricted by social distancing measures further slowing the process.
What have the candidates said.
Already have an account log in here
Both candidates are well aware of the fact that there might be delays.
Joe biden has been urged by hillary clinton not to concede on election night under any circumstances because i think this is going to drag out - he has said that he will only accept “the full results”
Donald trump has taken it a step further saying repeatedly that he might not accept the results at all he is doing his utmost to warn of voter fraud and election rigging - something which experts say is extremely rare the brennan center for justice said rates for voter fraud in elections it had studied ranged from 00003 per cent to 00025 per cent.
Americans need to be ready for the fact that a result might not be immediately obvious - and not take that as a sign of fraud three vital swing states - pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin - do not permit the counting of mailin ballots to begin until election day itself 
“we have to prepare for the very strong probability that an election unlike any other we’ve ever had might take a little longer to accurately count with integrity” said david becker executive director and founder of the washington dcbased nonpartisan center for election innovation - research 
“more time being taken to report results is not an indication of a problem”
So when will we know the results
The primaries give us some indication.
By 17 march almost half of all states 24 had held primaries five of those states heavily used votebymail as they had in previous elections they reported their results in an average of 64 days according to data analysed by the washington post.
The other 19 had mainly inperson voting and reported results on average after 15 hours.
After 17 march when the pandemic forced significant adjustments to voting systems there were primaries in 23 more states which took an average of four days to report nearly complete results nearly all of these states had traditionally relied on inperson voting.
New york processed 94 per cent of its votes within a few hours of polls closing but counting the final six per cent of votes took more than 10 days and one race in particular - for the congressional seat held by longterm congresswoman carolyn maloney - took six weeks to be resolved.
That suggests it could take around a week for the results to be clear and if both candidates accept the result the matter will be solved.
What happens if the candidates don’t accept the result.
If either candidate is still not satisfied a recount could be demanded.
In 2018 in florida a recount was demanded for three statewide races — for senator governor and agriculture commissioner.
The machine recount was ordered on november 10 with a deadline set for 8pm on november 15 
That was still inconclusive in the senate race so florida ordered its first ever recount by hand.
That was completed on november 18 and officially approved on november 20 - two weeks to the day after the november 6 vote
But even a recount result may be unlikely to resolve the issue mr trump has said he believes the election result could end up in the supreme court.
What would the supreme court involvement be
This has happened before in the 2000 election al gore the democratic candidate argued that his narrow margin of defeat in florida should lead to a recount.
It took 36 days and the supreme court to decide against a recount to settle the contest in favour of republican george w bush he like trump had lost the popular vote
Various legal challenges could emerge this year - everything from the identification requirements for postal voting to the legality of covidrelated changes to voting.
Is there a “Hard deadline” to all this
Inauguration day - always 20 january or 21 january if 20 january falls on a sunday - is set in the constitution under the 20th amendment enacted in 1933.
Before then the “lame duck” period stretched on until march and caused plenty of problems. 
In the secession winter after the election of abraham lincoln president james buchanan sat back and watched as secessionists seized federal forts and arsenals  by march 1861 when lincoln finally took office the civil war was nearly lost before it even began  
And in the midst of the great depression the lame duck period of president herbert hoover seemed far too long in response the 20th amendment was proposed and adopted.
So 20 january 2021 is therefore considered the ultimate hard deadline 
And if there are still problems.
If the election result is not confirmed and accepted by then the united states will be plunged into a deeply partisan constitutional crisis
Vote counters at work it remains unclear how long it will take to declare the results of the us election.
Ap.
Donald trump and joe biden will likely not know who will reside in the white house until several days after the november 3 vote

Dalton mass - a stack of hay bales on a massachusetts farm decorated in support of the democratic presidential ticket that was burned down has been replaced with a similar display with a different message.
The original display at holiday brook farm in dalton featured 19 wrapped hay bales painted with the words “usa and “vote along with the names of democratic presidential nominee joe biden and vice presidential candidate kamala harris
A local man is -        accused of burning it down on friday evening no one was hurt.
The new nearly identical stack of hay bales now says “love unity respect” and features a pair of us flags a globe and the word “vote”
Farm owner dicken crane told         the boston globe - he decided on the new message after seeing the widespread attention drawn by his first display.
“we really didn’t want to increase the divisiveness around the election” crane said monday “It’s a message that we really hope this country is about if we respect unity and love it makes the names on the political message less important.”
The suspect lonnie durfee 49 of dalton pleaded not guilty tuesday to burning personal property he was held without bail pending a hearing to determine whether he is a danger to society which is scheduled for friday the berkshire eagle -        reported.
Prosecutors requested the hearing based on a prior arrest for assault and battery in 2014.
A voicemail message was left tuesday with durfees attorney.
Durfee used motor oil and gasoline to set the display alight because he “Disagreed with the political stance it represented” according to the police report.
He apologized and offered to pay for the damages estimated at about 2000 the report said.

There may never be an effective vaccine for coronavirus boris johnson has warned.
Speaking to the house of commons the prime minister said there were “some very hopeful signs.” that a covid-19 jab would be developed.
But he warned mps that there is still no inoculation for the similar sars virus 18 years after the outbreak which killed more than 700 people world-wide in 2002
Mr johnson said earlier this month that he believed the “scientific equation” would change over the coming months with progress on vaccines and testing allowing the world to get on top of coronavirus.
But asked today when he expected that to happen he admitted it “cannot be taken for granted”
Following the pm’s announcement of a new covid alert level system in a statement to the commons tory mp steve baker asked “by when does mr johnson expect to have vaccinated the vulnerable population what is his confidence in that date and why does he have that confidence”

President donald trump claimed without evidence that demonstrators were ‘Biden fools’
Find your bookmarks in your independent premium section under my profile
Protesters in portland overturned statues of theodore roosevelt and abraham lincoln on sunday as president donald trump claimed the demonstrators were “Biden fools.”
The protest organisers called the event the “Indigenous peoples day of rage” in response to monday’s federal holiday columbus day which is named after the 15thcentury italian explorer christopher columbus according to cbs news.
Activists who have been campaigning for the removal of monuments to columbus across the us over the last few months argue that the italian explorer mistreated indigenous people upon his arrival to the americas
At around 9pm on sunday protesters in portland oregon toppled the statue of roosevelt titled theodore roosevelt rough rider before throwing red paint on the monument and using a blowtorch on its base
The associated press reported that roosevelt – president from 1901 to 1909 – expressed hostility towards native americans and once said “I dont go so far as to think that the only good indians are dead indians but i believe nine out of every 10 are”
Eight minutes later rhe protesters then pulled down a statue of lincoln.
They spray painted “Dakota 38” on the base of lincoln’s statue in reference to the 38 native american men the former us president approved to be hanged after they were involved in a conflict with white settlers.

Over the last few months there has been a growing conversation in the us about the place of symbols of the confederacy and perpetrators of racial injustice following the death of unarmed black man george floyd in minneapolis on 25 may.
Numerous monuments to confederate officials and soldiers have been toppled across the us as have statues commemorating columbus.
Black lives matter protests have also taken place in every state across the us while portland residents held demonstrations for more than 100 days this summer following floyd’s death.
On monday morning mr trump captioned video footage of the protests without any evidence “these are biden fools antifa radicals get them fbi and get them now”
Mr trump other high profile republicans and fox news hosts have criticised protests over the last few months highlighting incidents of violence and vandalism at demonstrations across the country.
However in late september the armed conflict location - event data project acled analysed more than 7750 black lives matter protests across the us and found that 93 per cent of the demonstrations were peaceful.
Despite the toppling of statues and vandalism being counted as part of the project’s report the analysis only found 220 instances of violent protests between may and september.
President trump has also repeatedly claimed that antifa an umbrella term for various antifascist groups is behind violence at various protests in portland however federal prosecutors have not linked any demonstration arrests for federal crimes to the loosely organised group.
After the protesters toppled the statues on sunday the group smashed windows of the oregon historical society and the portland state university campus public safety office.
The police later declared the event a riot and said that anyone involved in “criminal behaviour including vandalism” would be arrested so far no arrests have been announced.

Despite an extraordinary government bailout america’s agriculture sector remains under severe economic pressure
By alan rappeport.
Washington — for the american farmers president trump counts on for support the government money is flowing faster than ever.
Federal payments to farmers are projected to hit a record 46 billion this year as the white house funnels money to mr trump’s rural base in the south and midwest ahead of election day.
The gush of funds has accelerated in recent weeks as the president looks to help his core supporters who have been hit hard by the double whammy of his combative trade practices and the coronavirus pandemic according to the american farm bureau debt in the farm sector is projected to increase by 4 percent to a record 434 billion this year and farm bankruptcies have continued to rise across the country.
Farmers are not the only constituency benefiting from the president’s largess he has promised 200 prescription drug cards to millions of seniors approved 13 billion in aid to puerto rico which could help his prospects in florida and he directed his agriculture department include letters signed by him in millions of food aid boxes that are being distributed to the poor.
Millions of food aid boxes that are being distributed include letters bearing president trump’s signature
But few have gotten more help than the agriculture sector which this year is expected to receive the largest government contribution to farm income since its previous record in 2005 according to the university of missouri’s food and agricultural policy research institute the breadth of the payments means that government support will account for about 40 percent of total farm income this year if not for those subsidies us farm income would be poised to decline in 2020
“there are both economic and political motivations for these payments” said patrick westhoff who directs university of missouri’s agriculture research center.
Last week the office of special counsel determined that mr trump’s agriculture secretary sonny perdue had improperly used his position to push the president’s reelection by promising more help for farmers at an august event in north carolina mr perdue violated ethics laws when he promoted mr trump’s reelection during remarks about the farmers to families food box program saying “that’s what’s going to continue to happen — four more years — if america gets out and votes for this man donald j trump.”
Mr perdue has been ordered to reimburse the government for the costs associated with his attendance at the event in its response to the office of special counsel the agriculture department said that mr perdue did not “encourage attendees to vote for a candidate or party or advocate for a partisan political group”
More money for farmers will soon be on the way congress recently agreed to replenish an agriculture department fund that mr trump has used to disburse nearly 30 billion to farmers at his discretion with tens of billions of additional dollars the trump administration negotiated with democrats to ensure the money was included in a shortterm bill to fund the federal government with the white house agreeing to more funds for child nutritional assistance in exchange.
Farmers have been clobbered financially during the last two years as mr trump’s trade wars with china and europe led to tariffs on american agricultural exports including corn soybeans lobsters and peanuts then this year the pandemic interfered with global supply chains and restaurant and hotel closures sapped demand farmers were forced to dump milk into manure pits and destroy millions of pounds of beans and cabbage.
“nearly every major sector of the farm economy will have lower cash receipts this year compared to last year and total cash receipts will be the lowest since 2010” john newton the american farm bureau’s chief economist wrote in a report on the state of the industry last month.
The desire to help struggling farmers is bipartisan but democrats and critics of the aid programs have argued that the money has been paid out unevenly by the trump administration and with the intent of currying favor with a politically important constituency in swing states.
“for the first time in history a president has repeatedly usurped congressional authority in order to personally dispense tens of billions of dollars in federal farm subsidy payments that would not otherwise have been paid” said ken cook president of environmental working group an advocacy organization that has been tracking the agriculture payments “this is an authoritarian power grab used to buy political support from voters who are essential to his reelection”
The president has only reinforced those concerns at a september campaign rally in wisconsin a big farm state mr trump announced that an additional 13 billion in aid would soon be paid out through the commodity credit corporation a pot of money that the trump administration had used to provide financial help to farmers suffering from retaliatory tariffs placed on american products
“I’m proud to announce that i’m doing even more to support wisconsin farmers.” mr trump said adding that some of that money would go to dairy cranberry and ginseng farmers in the state that have been hurt by the coronavirus pandemic.
Not all farmers received special payouts during the last three years but the trump administration has recently moved to ensure that those in critical states do not miss out.
That includes the tobacco industry which was prohibited from receiving any of the trade assistance because of legal restrictions against subsidizing the sector in september the agriculture department quietly shifted some of the funds that were allocated to its commodity credit corporation fund — which legally cannot subsidize tobacco — into a separate account that can bankroll the crop tobacco farmers will receive up to 100 million in payments easing some of the financial pain that has been felt particularly hard in the battleground state of north carolina.
The administration’s efforts have not erased the economic malaise and frustration among america’s farmers who have seen sales fall and bankruptcies rise the overall payouts have been large but they have not always gone to the farmers who need them most critics including both democrat and republican lawmakers have argued that small farmers have missed out on the bulk of the bailout while large and some foreignowned farms have benefited.
A government accountability office report in september added to suspicions among democrats that 145 billion of farm aid from 2019 was being allocated with politics in mind the report found that the bulk of the money went to big farms in the midwest and southern states including mr perdue’s home state of georgia.
“I do not believe that this president has been a true friend to farmers.” said senator debbie stabenow of michigan the top democrat on the senate’s agriculture committee who accused mr trump of “subverting the law” in the way he had doled out farm aid.
In a statement mr perdue denied that the money was being deployed for political purposes.
“president trump is once again demonstrating his commitment to ensure america’s farmers and ranchers remain in business to produce the food fuel and fiber america needs to thrive” he said.
Mr trump appears to have kept much of his farm support intact a september poll from dtnprogressive farmerzogby analytics found that 53 percent of rural adults approved of his handling of the job about 10 percentage points higher than his national approval rating.
It is not clear if that will be enough however given some bailout recipients remain unhappy with mr trump’s trade policies.
Graham boyd the executive vice president of the tobacco growers association of north carolina secured subsidies for his crops after his group and lobbyists from other tobacco growing states demonstrated to the agriculture department that farmers were losing hundreds of millions of dollars per year in lost exports to china north carolina is america’s largest tobacco growing state and china was its biggest customer but since 2018 beijing has not bought american tobacco.
“I think all of agriculture and tobacco are frustrated with the ongoing trade dispute” mr boyd said in an interview “It’s not resolved”
While the new subsidies will be welcome mr boyd noted that they would only amount to 10000 to 20000 per tobacco farmer.
“one hundred percent of these dollars will go to service debt” he said.
To some small farmers hearing about the big government subsidies without seeing meaningful payments firsthand only makes matters worse
Joel greeno a wisconsin farmer who switched from dairy to raising cattle said that despite the big headline aid numbers it was a myth that the trump administration had really helped small farms stay afloat he said that most of it is going to rich landowners and corporate agriculture companies.
“even though society believes that these programs that help farmers the money very rarely gets to farmers.” said mr greeno who is also president of the family farm defenders organization “Rural america is not seeing that money because it’s not getting here”
AdvertisementAdam shatzs classic profile of mike davis from 1997 shatz touches on the writing and success of city of quartz daviss time working at new left review and his general refusal to uncritically follow the postmodern trends of classskeptical left intellectual life into the late 20th century. 

Phoning mike davis is a good way of getting acquainted with his answering machine it is a virtually futile way of getting hold of the celebrated author of city of quartz before arriving in los angeles where davis lives and writes id had no luck reaching him sitting on his porch on a warm evening this past june i understood why the phone rang incessantly and davis never once rose from his chair.
The calls last from morning to midnight it might be the photographer richard avedon or the architect im pei with a request for one of daviss legendary tours of la it could be backlash author susan faludi whom davis has introduced to young gang members for her upcoming book on masculinity or former crip leader dewayne holmes a davis confidante who works in state senator tom haydens la office it might also be a danish curator mounting an exhibit on the postmodern city an organizer with the hotel workers union a student at uclas cesar chavez center or very likely a hollywood screenwriter what this motley crew has in common is a belief that mike davis holds the keys to understanding the city of los angeles and much else in his writings on southern california the american working class and the lives of the dispossessed davis offers dark parables of a postliberal america poised on the brink of ruin
Mike daviss reputation rests largely on city of quartz excavating the future in los angeles verso his 1990 chronicle of the citys history from the socialist cooperative of llano del río to blade runner­style capitalism the book appeared at a serendipitous moment a full decade of reaganism had remade american society in the image of southern california with its volatile mix of squalid inner cities and gated communities but city of quartz had merits of its own here was an urban history that took to heart lewis mumfords admonishment that rebuilding a city involves the larger task of rebuilding our civilization in arresting meditations on homeowners revolts daryl gatess police department frank gehrys aesthetics anglolatino conflicts within the catholic church and the death of the steel industry davis took the reader on a kaleidoscopic tour of contemporary la even as he offered vivid streetsmart reportage and frequently breathtaking prose davis projected a distinctive historical vision a new left marxism infused with workingclass nostalgiaand apocalyptic rage.
Contemporary urban america he flatly declared is more like victorian england than walt whitmans or la guardias new york in los angeles onceuponatime a demiparadise of free beaches luxurious parks and cruising strips genuinely democratic space is all but extinct the ozlike archipelago of westside pleasure domesa continuum of tony malls arts centers and gourmet stripsis reciprocally dependent upon the social imprisonment of the third-world service proletariat who live in increasingly repressive ghettoes and barrios even as the walls have come down in eastern europe they are being erected all over los angeles two years after the books publication came the la riots lending daviss analysis a luster of prophecy.
A more curious aspect of city of quartzs appeal was its design marrying postmodern cool and bogartian machismo robert morrows photograph of the eerily glamorous turquoise observatory of the metropolitan detention center graced the cover while william gibsons backcover blurb proclaimed the book more cyberpunk than any work of fiction could ever be although davis—with his boyish frame liquidblue eyes and gently weathered face—lacks any hint of menace in person his mug shot on the inside jacket radiated tough guy arms folded defiantly dressed in black glowering at the reader he was described as a native son and former meat cutter and longdistance truck driver who incidentally teaches urban theory at the southern california institute of architecture the packaging paid off city of quartz became a cult hit appealing to readers far beyond its target audience of leftleaning urban geographers and historians—including bruce willis a big donor to newt gingrich who was recently glimpsed reading the book in a new york times magazine feature
Meanwhile the man who blasted suburban escapism and took us down las mean streets has turned his attention to the furies of nature a move that may puzzle many of his admirers the ecology of fear which will be published next spring by metropolitan books is a richly eccentric study of the social and political significance of natural disasters treating environmental history as a window into larger class struggles davis argues that justice and ecology amount to the same thing in the land of sunshine unchecked urbanization has not only laid waste to democratic public space but transgressed environmental commonsense thus inviting natures revenge a work of distinctly millennial cadences the ecology of fear conjures up a catastropheprone landscape governed by a geological dialectic of ordinary disaster and visited occasionally by cougars snakes and killer bees the fire next time it seems may come from the sky as well as the streets

In the past few years davis has retreated from the publicintellectual circuit rarely granting interviews im really not that interesting he protests weakly coming from a man so attentive to the creation of his literary persona the selfeffacement can ring a little hollow but behind it lies the defensiveness of a proud outsider uneasy with celebrity mike is a very romantic guy who has this image of himself as a workingclass revolutionary says journalist alexander cockburn a longtime friend and admirer of davis for the better part of his adult life davis has been on the road he was still making ends meet as a truck driver long after many of his friends on the left found permanent sanctuary in the academy.
With city of quartz came the fruits—and the bruising ironies—of mainstream recognition las poor have seen little improvement in their lives since the riots while davis who took up his pen to dramatize their plight has acquired a small piece of the california dream the very idea he set out to debunk he received a 50000 advance for the ecology of fear he won a getty fellowship and he entered the ranks of la homeowners the vanguard of complacency in city of quartz moving into a modest graystucco house in pasadena just south of the san gabriel mountains he lives there with the mexican political artist alessandra moctezuma his fifth wife ever since i got a mortgage ive been corrupted davis half jokes ive been dreaming about my lawn and worrying about my property values.
That said he still has to hustle to make a living a tenuretrack position continues to elude davis who averages five adjunct courses a semester at various schools mike is a brilliant loose cannon and also a kind of wonderful political journalist and neither of these would be accepted by peers at a major university says daviss friend and erst-while employer ed soja a ucla geographer.
Davis who never completed his phd in history at ucla has his own misgivings about the academy as the father of two schoolage children he needs the security of a steady income but he has not made it easy for departments to bring him on board this spring the university of southern california nearly offered him an endowed chair in american history davis who had spray painted the universitys walls with antivietnam graffiti in 1965 was thrilled but warned administrators youll have intractable problems if you hire me when friends in the foodservice workers union informed him that the university was contracting out the jobs of its cafeteria workers davis assailed the school in the la weekly as the most reactionary institution in la a top administrator accused him of slander and the job was given to someone else
Even when his extracurricular politics are not the issue daviss pedagogical practices might well cause a university to think twice about tenuring him once while teaching at the southern california institute of architecture he devised an experiment to prove that one could feel reasonably safe in any neighborhood in la in the middle of the night one of his students a crown prince of fiji decided to test this idea in hollywood there he met a handful of drug dealers and they ended up having a marvelous timeuntil they were jumped by another group of dealers who stabbed and nearly killed the prince davis recalls when i visited him in the hospital i told him how sorry i was but he said no mike ill never be able to thank you for this i would never have experienced anything like it in fiji even so davis was almost fired over the incident i had to lie low for a while after that he says with a smile
Though davis may have become an angry messenger from the streets of la he doesnt originally hail from the city im a white middleaged workingclass guy who grew up in the far outer suburbs that turn out into the desert he says thats my existential relation to the metropolis
Davis was born in the dusty california town of fontana in 1946 the same year a group of fontanan motorcyclists founded the hells angels the fontana of daviss childhood wasnt paradise but there were plenty of decent jobs in henry kaisers steel mill and in trucking the unions were strong and management relatively liberal mikes father dwight davis worked in town as a meat cutter fontana looms large in the davis imagination largely as a place of lost possibilities over the ensuing years fontanas steel industry was gutted and what replaced it were inflated land prices and untrammeled development indeed remembering the fate of his hometown inspires davis to turn toward extravagant metaphors of disaster as he wrote in the final chapter of city of quartz the former primary steelworks itself looks like dresden hiroshima or perhaps the most fitting image tokyo in april 1945 after three months of concentrated firebombing with kaisermade goop.
Daviss family eventually moved to bostonia a hamlet east of san diego—and the crucible for the writers catastrophist sensibility a number of residents of this military town imagined themselves on the brink of annihilation thanks to rumors spread by the john birch society that an elite unit of chinese troops on the mexican border was poised to invade san diego on the weekends families would go to the marine recruiting depot to hear fiery anticommunist oratory and watch soldiers toss flamethrowers into the sky davis joined the devil pups the marines answer to the boy scouts and counted the days before he would go somewhere in asia to kill people for a while he was a real cold war fanatic.
When a heart attack left daviss father temporarily disabled his mother took her sixteenyearold son out of school and put him to work at the bostonia meat factory and there he might have stayed had it not been for a black civil rights activist named Jim stone.
The husband of daviss cousin carol stone cut a bold charismatic figure in 1962 davis accompanied stone to a demonstration against the all-white san diego branch of the bank of america it was a kind of conversion experience conducted under the most harrowing conditions a group of redneck sailors drenched us with lighter fluid and one of the guys started flicking his lighter he recalls under stones tutelage davis transformed himself into a political activist working at the san diego offices of the congress of racial equality core he finished high school and landed a full scholarship to reed college.
His stay in oregon however was short and unhappy painfully aware of being a workingclass kid among the children of doctors and lawyers he became belligerent ultimately getting himself expelled for living illegally in his girlfriends dorm so davis returned to fulltime activism in 1964 he joined students for a democratic society sds spending the next three years organizing sitins and protests on the west coast as the vietnam war escalated he grew further radicalized eventually joining the communist party for nearly two years he managed the partys bookstore in la not far from fbi headquarters.
In 1969 after being fired by dorothy healey the regional party leader for hounding the russian cultural attaché out of the storedavis despised the soviets and didnt like them snooping aroundhe enrolled in a teamsters opportunity program for the next four years he hauled 240foot trailers filled with barbie dolls out of la acquiring an encyclopedic knowledge of the city as well as of western geography in his spare time he tried to master marxs capital and sartres search for a method and paid visits to herbert marcuse fellow leftwing truckers were rather hard to come by at night wed go out to topless bars and id blurt out im a communist and theyd say dicks a jehovahs witness lets have another drink.
One day davis decided he had had enough and that he wanted to resume his education a particularly jolting experience clinched his decision i had this job with a bustour company when suddenly this insanely violent strike broke out a strikebreaker ran a bus over one of our guys and next thing i knew i was in a room with forty guys voting on whether each of us is gonna put up 400 to hire a hit man to kill the head of the strikebreakers i said hey guys this is just crazy and made the best speech of my life i was outvoted thirtynine to one i thought to myself typical american workers i think i said pussies instead of coming up with a political strategy they reach for their guns as soon as they see a scab driving their bus and here i am about to become a freshman at ucla and im going to get arrested for criminal conspiracy ironically davis was saved by the la police department which apprehended the hit men for drunk driving and seized their guns the west-wood campus started to look like a pretty good alternative to trucking given the dues the teamsters union seemed to require of its members.

As always though davis grew restless after three years at ucla he packed his bags for scotland on a fellowship to study irish history he was soon dividing his time among london edinburgh and belfast—conducting research and agitating for the independence of northern ireland but what set his intellectual career in motion was falling in with a small but brilliant circle of european marxists gathered around the new left review through his association with the fourth international a trotskyist group davis met nlr editor perry anderson who had just published lineages of the absolutist state a magisterial history of european monarchies though andersons aristocratic background couldnt have been more distant from daviss own robin blackburn the current nlr editor recalls that they seemed kindred spirits both possessing this gift for mapping large trends when davis returned to complete his bachelors at ucla and begin graduate study in history he kept in close contact with anderson finally after reading daviss erudite essay on the regulation school a group of french marxist economists anderson offered davis a fulltime position at nlr.
From 1980 to 1986 davis worked out of the journals london offices he read voraciously he established the haymarket series of verso nlrs publisher specializing in radical studies of north american politics and culture and he began publishing chapters of his first book an acerbic analysis of the american working class from the early nineteenth century to the reagan years.
Published by verso in 1986 and dedicated to el salvadors guerrilla army prisoners of the american dream was like a grenade thrown at the new labor history pioneered by herbert gutman where the gutmanites piously stressed the valiant resistance of american workers to capitalist power davis distinguished himself as the great antisentimentalist american workers had indeed shown extraordinary militancy but the more important fact was that they had almost nothing to show for it splintered by racial and ethnoreligious divisions confronted by an exceptionally large middle class and lacking a social democratic party the american labor movement had drifted from one defeat to the next disarmedbefore the challenges and battles of the following period reaganisms successful assault on labor was the grim coda to this dirge.
It was only fitting that davis should find his calling as a critic of reaganism according to his friend writer barry sanders mike had always been preparing for the worst now it had arrived in 1980 the worst nightmares of the american left appeared to come true davis wrote like some shaggy beast of the apocalypse reaganism hunkered out of the sunbelt devouring liberal senators and great society programs in its path in an analysis of reaganisms social base davis argued that a protean broad right backed by openshop sun belt corporations and affluent homeowners would decisively reshape american politics the neoliberal democratic leadership council would conquer the democratic party while the republican party would adopt the highgrowth proentrepreneurial platform of kemp and gingrich but for all his prescience davis occasionally let his apocalyptic streak and his love of incendiary metaphor run wild as in his vision of a future american west bank of terrorized illegal laborers.
Although prisoners received overwhelmingly favorable reviews in historical journals and the left press it drew sharp criticism for presenting a closed and bleak universe that seemed almost wholly resistant to reform in an otherwise laudatory review in the nation yale labor historian david montgomery asked what role are the prisoners to play in their own liberation at the offices of nlr some had a similar reaction mike is an exceptionally astute analyst of the enemy but if i were an american trade union leader i wouldnt go to him to ask which way forward editorial board member tariq ali told me.
By and large however the nlr board was elated to have a precocious american—better yet a precocious workingclass american—wash up on its shores marxists have long had this feeling that america shows us our future explains blackburn mikes very robust american workingclass style further contributed to his charm yet as even this circumspect editor concedes tact wasnt his strong suit some staffers thought davis exploited his background mike could be psychotic he was very inyourface about his identity says a former nlr editor as davis himself admits ive always had a sort of truckstop attitude toward effete intellectuals.
Among the first to feel its blows was marxist literary critic par excellence fredric jameson in his classic 1984 article the cultural logic of late capitalism jameson had breathlessly described las hotel bonaventure as the archetypal postmodern structure its multiple entryways elevated gardens and glass mirrored surfaces formed a delirious hyperspace inciting those who entered it to expand our sensorium while noting in passing that the hotels glass skin repels the city outside jameson breezily praised the hotel as a popular building visited with enthusiasm by locals and tourists alike daviss response was unsparing to speak of its popular character is to miss the point of its systematic segregation from the great hispanicasian city outside he thundered in nlr where jamesons essay had also appeared cutting through jamesons theoretical haze davis emphasized the smogpoisoned reality outside and described the hotel as part of an ominous trend of large vivariums for the upper middle classes protected by astonishingly complex security systems in the endnotes to his 1991 book postmodernism jameson curtly dismissed davis as characteristic of the more militant sounds from the left.
Daviss confrontational pose made for an unusually anxious workplace at one nlr meeting he stunned his audience into silence with the letter he had sent to eugene genovese who had complained of being spurned by the journal dear professor genovese fuck you then there was daviss terrifying collection of pets the centerpiece of the office was his atrarium filled with a garter snake an axolotl and a carnivorous african toad at an explosive moment toward the end of his tenure recalled by everyone who witnessed it davis spilled his reptiles onto the offices lush carpet.
When i ask davis about this he strikes a remorseful note if anyone was guilty of wild or outrageous behavior it was me he concedes in the end though he says he never felt a part of the etonian clique around the journal ultimately you couldnt really understand these guys unless youd taken showers with them when you were ten he longed to go home.
In 1987 mike davis returned to la he took a job as a trucker again this time for a highend furniture company there was no union and wages had declined i felt like a sharecropper on the interstate he says the industry had regressed to the conditions of the thirties to supplement his income davis picked up a few teaching positions at local colleges he also began work on a manuscript arguing that the california gold rush was the only successful revolution of 1848 the manuscript was lost—thats what happens when you move too much—and he ended up writing city of quartz instead.
The idea for city of quartz had been germinating for years i had this daydream of walter benjamin finally coming to la and sitting in a bar with fernand braudel and friedrich engels they decide to write a book about la and divide it into three projects benjamin is going to get at all the complex and lucid fragments about power and memory braudel will explore its natural history the larger worldhistorical forces that made it possible and engels will report on las working classes city of quartz was to be the first volume in this imaginary trilogy the title came from a poem written by daviss old sds comrade todd gitlin who compared political struggle to quartz hard and sharp i thought it applied better to la because it implied something that looks like diamond but is really cheap translucent but nothing can be seen in it.
City of quartz began by looking at los angeles from the ruins of its alternative future—the community of llano del río a turnofthecentury socialist commune in the mojave desert davis did not seriously entertain the idea that llano del río represented a plausible future if anything his choice of this shortlived experiment made contemporary la seem an all but foregone conclusion but the conceit held up an unforgiving mirror to the behemoth that la had become a carceral city of swelling black and immigrant poverty prisons filled to capacity and capitalist mansions defended by sinister new forms of public and private security.
Since the early eighties urban geographers with an interest in las emergence as a center of international capital and immigration had been mapping these divisions indeed there arose a whole school of radical la geography one of whose members likened the city to jorge luis borgess aleph a limitless space of simultaneity and paradox impossible to describe in less than extraordinary language the la schools edge was blunted however by its never less than cryptic prose which only planners and poststructuralists could untangle much of what davis did was translate these approaches into vibrant english and infuse them with reportorial flair and a sense of throbbing immediacy.
Indeed at a time when many leftist writers were embroiled in increasingly arcane debates about the nature of postmodernism daviss hardnosed treatment of gang warfare police brutality nimby protests and the machinations of realestate moguls satisfied a craving on the left for reportage grounded in a sense of lived reality as urban theorist marshall berman put it in his nation review city of quartz was marxist in a refreshingly archaic way moreover the dantean portrait davis drew of the city was calculated to resonate beyond its sprawling borders just as llano del río was a standin for collectivist yearnings so la was a metaphor for all that had gone wrong in urban america since the disintegration of the great society of course daviss take on la was not wholly original in 1946 his hero the southern california chronicler carey mcwilliams had sorrowfully described la as an archipelago of social and ethnic islands economically interrelated but culturally disparate but a quarter century after the defeat of segregation daviss frank discussion of spatial apartheid spoke with eloquent directness to the gnawing sense among his readers that class and racial cleavages had widened that shared public space was disappearing and that inner cities were becoming cauldrons of discontent city of quartz fed into a kind of leftliberal guilt because mike was saying a lot of things that people felt but were afraid to say explains uclas ed soja
Davis further distinguished himself from his fellow geographers by writing compellingly about california noir novels and films rap and avantgarde jazz and most memorably architecture he contended that las trendiest postmodern edifices were highsecurity fortressestheir aesthetic performing the same bullying function as the ubiquitous armed response signs on brentwood lawns whats more he heaped scorn on the work of frank gehry the most outspokenly leftwing of local architects and a fellow son of workingclass parents gehrys gold-wyn library in spanish hollywood is undoubtedly the most menacing library ever built davis wrote with its fifteenfoot security walls of stuccocovered concrete block its antigraffiti barricades covered in ceramic tiles the gold-wyn libraryprojects the same kind of macho exaggeration as dirty harrys 44 magnum ironically daviss audacious theory of architecture as classwarfarebyothermeans made waves in an art world that had embraced gehrys own very different brand of swagger since city of quartz davis has participated in documenta written regularly for the soho quarterly grand street and become the main attraction along with dutch architect rem koolhaas of voyagers radical urban theory web site

City of quartz received scant criticism—too little says davis according to ed soja daviss geographer peers felt cowed by his access to bluecollar life and his activist credentials mike was able to kind of tweak this longing this envy among university academics who often feel they inhabit an iron cage soja tells me his image was so attractive it made criticism of the book seem unappealing.
But daviss marxistnoir vision of la did find some detractors joel kotkin a leading la booster at pepperdines business school and author of tribes how race religion and family determine success in the new global economy has lambasted davis as the poster boy for a new york left that hates los angeles in his view daviss despairing opinion of las prospects was all wrong davis should go to detroit where hed really have something to write about similarly in a new york times review of city of quartz titled if this is hell why is it so popular historian bryce nelson noted that many of the millions of newcomers to los angelesare even glad that they moved there for all his praise marshall berman closed his nation review with a cautionary note reminding davis that radical jeremiads against lahave always been incorporated into the citys official mythology.
So it was with davis even though city of quartz explicitly distanced itself from dystopian visions that glamorize the very reality they would deconstruct the citys culture industry devoured it nonetheless it was avidly read—or perhaps misread—by people indifferent to his political vision he was invited to speak at luncheons before rich old ladies he was courted by the unionbusting la times he felt foisted on his petard yet the astounding thing is not that it happened but that davis was surprised it did he either underestimated what he called the city myth or overestimated the lone writers ability to resist it or some combination of the two whatever the case davis attempted to nip his stardom in the bud—often in ways that ironically caused it to flower he became notorious for not showing up at speaking appointments and engaged in antics that fed into his bad boy reputation one colleague sighs mikes like the child in whom you take the most pride but despair of ever doing the normal thing as hes grown more successful his need to be at the margins has increased and the only way to do that is through these weird acts of disappearance.

But davis did not vanish he merely sought different company he strengthened his ties to a network of la labor activists from maria elena durazo of local 11 the hotel workers union to eric mann of the laborcommunity strategy center he met with black and latino writers like lynell george and ruben martinez and cultivated them as authors for the haymarket series and most controversially he became a mentor to young gang members.
Even though city of quartz featured a scorching critique of the lapds campaign against las viet cong the book ultimately came down hard on the crips and the bloods davis excoriated the gangs as pitiless ghetto reaganites the modern analogues to the gunpowder states of west africa in the early nineties davis came to reassess his harsh view of the gangs as he befriended a crip leader named dewayne holmes the son of daviss friend theresa allison a south central activist meeting holmes in 1991 davis was immediately struck by the qualities that established him as a leader at a very young age—his modesty and sweetness at the time the twentyfouryearold crip was cobbling together a truce with the bloods in the imperial courts project before long davis took on the role of informal adviser to holmes and his peers mike helped us to contextualize our struggle to get at the underlying problems and causes of crime and poverty holmes explained to me around the same time a group of crips and bloods started to wage what davis has praised as a lonely crusade to make jobsand not more copsthe central issue in local politics three days before the rodney king verdict dewayne holmes sealed a historic truce with the bloods.
Since then no cause has touched davis more profoundly than the peace process he has become a passionate advocate for california senate bill 980 which would authorize a peace process task force to oversee gang truces leading the effort is none other than dewayne holmes who now works as a staffer in tom haydens office the bill has a groundswell of support since the truces are widely credited with reducing violence as davis exclaims to me one evening senate bill 980 is one of the most progressive things to come along in a while these gangs need positive reinforcement and recognition for their efforts
Joel kotkin sees romantic illusions about the lumpenproletariat in daviss association with the gangs i dont see the gangs as junior revolutionaries and the city should have zero tolerance for them kotkin says daviss writing on gangs has not always been temperate in a buoyant appraisal of the gangs proposal to rebuild la in nlr davis wrote of the truce leaders as social democrats i ask him whether some of them were also in the business of selling crack yes he says but that isnt the important point what people on the outside dont grasp is that the kids involved understand their circumstances better than anyone else what theyre saying is we can produce a truce but we cant do anything about the crack economy until you provide jobs and alternative economic resources.
It was a bit strange to hear davis defending the wisdom of gang members a few hours earlier he had spoken poignantly of his growing doubts about revolutionary violence and of his turn toward feminism as i became a parent i started to think about the masculinization of revolution and i started to think that the position that socialism has to take instead is that of mothers too much of the history of revolutions has been the calculations of young men and a failure to understand the consequences of this for women and children now a few hours later he seemed to side with the gangs—or had these angry young men assumed the position of the mother by exchanging their guns for the olive branch.

Perhaps davis was expressing a war correspondents weariness despite his anxieties about public exposure he had been thrust into the spotlight by the april 1992 riots which starkly confirmed city of quartzs vision of a whole generationbeing shunted toward some impossible armageddon the man who had predicted the upheaval seemed after all like the ideal person to explain it and for a while he did just that in the pages of the nation and nlr the riots he argued were a referendum on the fate of american big cities a raw protest against federal disinvestment welfare cuts and deteriorating services he had a contract for a book on the riots a neighborhoodbyneighborhood account that would reveal the complexity of this first multiracial uprising then one day he decided he could not write it.
In part davis felt that members of the community rather than a white intellectual should tell their story and yet he had deeper reasons for abandoning the project davis had entered the lives of his subjects and the idea of being the outside worlds informant agonized him i knew georgiana williams whose son damon almost killed reginald denny davis tells me i knew their whole story and i think i had a very powerful concept for a book that would have been a bestseller in the hands of a jonathan kozol but mentally i couldnt handle it i was too close and i was ultimately just sickened by dead teenagers in la i didnt want to live with it twentyfour hours a day as teenage corpses piled up on television screens providing a freakishly morbid frisson in peoples living rooms davis grew wary of documentary intrusion into peoples suffering he recalls i was sitting in dublin one new years eve watching the sky channel when suddenly this image comes up its the lapd chasing kids in imperial courts where dewayne holmes used to live the plight of the inner city was being turned into an electronic gladiatorial arena.
Urban blight has become furthermore an almost mundane spectacle rather than a premonition of future riots las power brokers—and a number of its citizensare in a happier frame of mind than they were five years ago after all the economy has been on the rebound since the devastating 1990­1992 recession the aerospace industry has ceased to shrink and light manufacturing and film have created some new jobs the city has twice elected richard riordan a republican multimillionaire as mayor most recently against a progressive challenger tom hayden on april 12 of this year the economist ran an article under the headline a little more like angels saluting riordans victory and portraying angelenos as eager for another round of vigorous growth according to joel kotkin who is riding the wave of the recovery story davis has been upstaged mikes fortunes rise and fall with how widely accepted the catastrophic view of la is during the depression stalin looked very attractive after the war recovery he did not mike cant make or break la but frankly if we lost all our leftwing social scientists our growth rate would increase by 5 percent.
Davis is not about to give up catastrophism because of todays hype however voter turnout in the last mayoral election plummeted to 20 percent a historic low youth unemployment in south central stands at 30 percent and the prisons are running davis quips on automatic pilot its a matter of time he says before we see a huge new explosion of poverty and probably worse

But the greatest dangers according to daviss new work are the ones coming from nature the ecology of fear was inspired by the floods fires and earthquakes of 1992­1994 i found something i was far happier doing he explains because i was so exhausted from writing despairing things about la this shift in mood is mirrored sometimes alarmingly in the book it is not always clear whether the catastrophist is writing to avoid or to greet tomorrows natural disasters.
With its elegiac protest against the frenzy of freemarket development the ecology of fear at times resembles a green sequel to city of quartz in one chapter how eden lost its garden davis looks back on the defeated report of the citizens committee on parks playgrounds and beaches which proposed to protect floodplains and hillsides from realestate speculation and to expand recreational facilities in workingclass urban neighborhoods according to davis the 1930 report is a window into a lost future just at the moment when a vigorous social democracy of beaches and playgrounds might have bloomed southern california governments allowed cities to fall into disrepair while lavishly subsidizing private affluent firebelts—daviss term for suburban communities knowingly established in wild-fire corridors by allowing realestate interests and homeowners to call the shots southern california has reaped flood fire and earthquake tragedies that were as avoidable and unnatural as the beating of rodney king and the ensuing explosion in the streets according to davis theres a clear solution end all further development and create a green city.
Yet theres a twist southern california davis argues lacks the stable ecosystem that many environmentalists take for granted he conjures up a revolutionary not a reformist landscape one where floods droughts and other disasters are the ordinary agents of landscape and climatic change one of the points im trying to make in the book he tells me is that southern california was urbanized in one of the most anomalously benign periods in the last five thousand years how much time do we have before the next round of disasters reduces the la lifestyle to ruins you could get fifty or one hundred more years but very few seismologists believe this will continue
Davis long an enthusiastic reader of natural history has emerged as a committed partisan of scientific neocatastrophism this increasingly influential school of thought has dealt a powerful blow to the uniformitarian theory of gradual continuous evolution by demonstrating that extreme sudden events may spark spectacular shifts in both geological and natural history the opening salvo against uniformitarianism was launched by theorists of plate tectonics who saw the hand of undersea volcanoes and other violent mechanisms of change in the earths design but plate tectonics still retained the notion of the earth as a closed system—thereby inviting the more radical effort to bridge the gap between geology and astronomy following the lead of ucberkeley geologist walter alvarez who discovered a hundredmilewide crater in the yucatán the socalled coherent catastrophists have suggested that asteroid impacts may be responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs as well as other cataclysms.
What attracted davis to neocatastrophism the answer it turns out was political when you look at the actual history of capitalism it is not economic crises but wars that are truly decisive i started to think what would have been the consequences for historical materialism if you took seriously the idea that the axis could have won what kind of mode of production would have been established marx and engels believed that at the end of the day force couldnt just hijack the trajectory of history i think that it can i think that if the axis had won history would have been deflected into a whole set of bizarre permutations possibly back into a period of darkness since i was also reading natural history and earth sciences at the time i became especially interested in neocatastrophism which represents a kind of downfall of systems theory and a turn toward unique events and to radical contingency and chaos.
Given his fascination with political upheavals its not altogether surprising that davis would seek their equivalents in nature but he has gone even further in a recent tribute to neocatastrophism in nlr he suggested that asteroids may have played an important role in the course of human history itself noting the claims of two austrian scientists that biblical floods were caused by seven large cometary fragments that struck the ocean nearly ten millennia ago he mused that impact craters might be the functional equivalents of wars and revolutions in human history daviss larger point was that the earth is not a closed system its history and the history of its inhabitants can only be understood in relation to that of the universe along with many scientists he believes the paths of global and galactic history may be due to cross in the future—possibly with dramatic results at times he even seems to relish the more cinematic hypotheses of extraterrestrial collision especially those close to home a 500meterdiameter asteroid impact in the pacific say 1000 kilometers off the coast of los angeles could produce a tsunami several kilometers in height.
Such talk may appeal to fans of disaster scenarios but its certain to alienate some davis admirers im a bit puzzled by the turn to millennial catastrophism tariq ali says i mean the planet could i suppose be destroyed by asteroids but hasnt that always been the case meanwhile mike should be studying politics and geography instead of this theyllcomefromouterspace stuff the remarkable balance between grassroots reporting and prophetic tropes that davis achieved in city of quartz may be sliding like some tectonic plate in favor of the latter.

Then again if la does fall off the face of the earth within the next fifty years davis doesnt plan to be around to witness it he wants to leave la some day—and move to butte montana once a mecca of copper mines and labor socialism butte is now one of the sad hollowedout corners of the industrial west that locals yearn to escape but davis who discovered butte with his young daughter while on a trip across the four hundred miles of the pony express route dreams of retiring there i just love these places everyone thinks of as the armpits of the world he says one evening davis then shows me a series of photographs he took recently in montana the first thing you see upon entering butte is the socialist hall he says pointing proudly to a turnofthecentury building on a vacant street.
One could see why he was attracted to these ruins of the industrial age but why would he want to live there fontana where i was born is a lot like butte he explains but unlike the fontana of his childhood socialist butte was left to decay in peace dodging the developers onrushing bulldozers the socialist hall might be empty but it still offers shelter from the gathering storms of catastrophe some may see in daviss pilgrimage a nostalgia for robust workingclass cultures of the past others an anticipation of convulsions to come in daviss imagination the two have always gone hand in hand.

Novak Djokovic versus rafael nadal has been the tennis matchup of this era nearly half their fiftysix matches have been tournament finals nine of those grand slam finals the final they played in melbourne at the 2012 australian open won by Djokovic is widely considered the greatest hardcourt match of all time their fiveset french open semifinal the following summer won by nadal remains the finest claycourt men’s match this fan has ever watched Djokovic and nadal entered sunday’s french open final ranked no 1 and no 2 respectively nadal was second with nineteen and Djokovic third with seventeen on the alltime list of major championships behind only roger federer with twenty they have not only been battling each other for a long time but for so much of that time for the highest stakes it’s a rivalry unrivalled.
Great rivalries don’t always yield great matches nadal won this year’s final in paris his gobsmacking thirteenth 6–0 6–2 7–5 it brought to an end a french open delayed four months by the coronavirus pandemic and played most days beneath the mizzling skies that with game birds on the menu and chestnuts beneath the trees lend paris its particular autumnal ambience a somber moodiness deepened this year by a gathering second wave of covid-19 much of paris was closing up again and the players were confined to a couple of hotels only a thousand fans were permitted inside the main show court at roland garros court philippe chatrier they wore masks mostly black and with temperatures in the fifties what they call doudounes puffer jackets mostly black chatrier has a new retractable roof and it was closed on sunday with rain in the forecast and this added to a gloom nadal spoke about after winning his firstround match against the belarusian journeyman egor gerasimov “the feeling is more sad than usual” nadal said “Maybe that’s what it needs to feel like it needs to be sad many people in the world are suffering”
Nadal carried no despondency with him onto the court on sunday he broke Djokovic’s serve in the very first game held his serve then broke Djokovic again—and after another hold broke him again before a last hold to close out the set but the scoring line in tennis can be among the least revealing of any sport it took nadal a fair amount of time fortyfive minutes to bagel Djokovic half of the six games went to long deuces there were a number of lengthy remarkable rallies and there were a couple of new wrinkles one of the things that draw your attention watching a match between longtime rivals is what if any changes they introduce to their games so familiar now to each other players who have won as often and for as long as Djokovic and nadal are not especially eager to alter their oncourt ways but here was Djokovic feathering drop shots lots of them as he had throughout the tournament reasoning that the weatherdampened red clay would yield bounces so low that even nadal wouldn’t reach them mostly wrong nadal got there more often than not and struck the winners Djokovic was seeking with those droppers here too was nadal not running around the ball as often as he tends to to hit his peerless topspin forehand inside out—all tournament with the rather moist clay he hadn’t been getting his patented high bounce off that shot instead he took those balls with his backhand often slicing it short and low mostly right Djokovic mistimed more than a few forehands off those slices resulting in errors on such alterations and some patchy serving from Djokovic nadal’s firstset bagel was built and when rafael nadal wins the first set of a grand slam match he is going to win the match.
If anything set two seemed more lopsided than the first with Djokovic’s unforced errors piling up and nadal playing ridiculously clean tennis mishitting very few balls and gliding to the corners as if he were grasping the direction of an incoming shot before it had left Djokovic’s racquet he was the quicker man on court this day—did skipping the us open help his often ailing knees he would turn out to be the calmer player too in the middle of the third set broken for the first time he broke Djokovic right back Djokovic began pressing going for more hitting bigger and aiming early in points for the lines—what was there left to do serving to save a break point at 5–all he reached back for something extra on his second serve and the ball arced fiercely down the t    and just missed he was broken one last time and a couple of minutes later nadal had as many grand slam victories as his other great rival roger federer.
There are no current rivalries in women’s tennis for rivalries to develop two or three or four of the best players have to be consistently great over a stretch of years and thus move on through tournaments to test one another in consequential matches for years serena williams simply dominated williams has arguably never had a rival and she certainly hasn’t had one since her midaughts battles with belgium’s justine henin what women’s tennis does have today is depth twenty or so of the top players are capable of making a run at any tournament and the last couple of years have seen the arrival of a passel of young players with absorbing stories and engaging oncourt personalities who have made the women’s game more compelling week in and week out than the men’s
Iga swiatek that’s eega shveeontek is the latest a nineteenyearold from poland who arrived at roland garros ranked outside the wta top 50 and in possession of no winner’s trophy on the tour of any kind so why shouldn’t she clobber the no 1 seed simona halep the best women’s claycourt player in the game in the fourth round 6–1 6–2 why shouldn’t she earn a place in the women’s final by never dropping a set and never losing more than five games in a match and why shouldn’t she keep playing at that level a remarkable level in the women’s final defeating the young american sofia kenin 6–4 6–1 in less than ninety minutes.
Swiatek who is listed at fivenine but seems taller moves better laterally than most women her height she already has a keen sense of anticipation and fluent adroit adjustment steps once she closes in on the ball her service return too—usually the last thing a player develops—is formidable and by the end of saturday’s match she was intimidating kenin with it moving inside the baseline to smack second serves deep to the corners her biggest weapon though is her forehand she strikes it with an extreme western grip under the racquet like her idol growing up rafael nadal she doesn’t generate the protonic topspin that he does nobody does but her forehand does loop down deep in the court and even with the clay on chatrier yielding lower bounces those bounces were shoulder high to kenin who as a result couldn’t step into enough of her groundstrokes swiatek oddly also has a way of bending her hitting arm and drawing it in toward her torso as she swings her forehand and vehemently torques—like a batter in baseball turning on an inside pitch when she’s able to take an incoming ball out in front of her with that forehand swing the angles she can achieve are impossibly acute swiatek hit twentyfive winners against kenin whose movement may have been impaired a bit by a left thigh that was taped the entire second week of the tournament and which she had retaped twice during the final but kenin couldn’t wrestle control even of those points that didn’t find her on the run especially in the second set swiatek was just too good off the ground with steadiness in longer points to match her pace and topspinning heaviness and too unperturbable even in a moment as big as tennis provides she travels with a sports psychologist and meditates during changeovers.
Swiatek’s body language from the start was that of the champion she became she is the first polish player to win a major singles title she is also the youngest french open winner since    rafa nadal in 2005 we can only hope that she and her talented young peers—among them bianca andreescu who won the us open last year ash barty the 2019 french open winner naomi osaka who won the us open last month for her third major and kenin too who is only twentyone and won the australian open this year—stay healthy and hatch a rivalry or two.

Morgan -        the hall of fame second baseman who became the sparkplug of dominant cincinnati teams in the mid-1970s and the prototype for baseball’s artificial turf era has died he was 77.
He died at his home sunday in danville california family spokesman james davis said in statement monday morgan was suffering from a nerve condition a form of polyneuropathy.
“joe morgan was quite simply the best baseball player i played against or saw” reds hall of fame catcher johnny bench texted to the associated press.
Morgan’s death marked the latest among major league greats this year whitey ford bob gibson lou brock tom seaver and al kaline.
“all champions this hurts the most” bench said.
Morgan was a twotime nl most valuable player a 10time allstar and won five gold gloves a dynamo known for flapping his left elbow at the plate little joe could hit a home run steal a base and disrupt any game with his daring.
Most of all he completed cincinnati’s twotime world series championship team boosting a club featuring the likes of pete rose tony perez and bench to backtoback titles.
“joe would always amaze me” rose told the ap “he was by far the most intelligent player ive ever been around he rubbed off on all of us a big part of the big red machine”
Morgan’s tiebreaking single with two outs in the ninth inning of game 7 in 1975 gave the reds the crown in a classic matchup with boston and he spurred a fourgame sweep of the yankees the next season.
Morgan was the league’s mvp both years and his hall of fame teammates and manager readily acknowledged he was the one that got it all started.
Often regarded as the greatest second baseman in history he was an easy firstballot pick for cooperstown.
“he was just a good major league player when it didn’t mean anything” former reds and tigers skipper sparky anderson once said “but when it meant something he was a hall of famer”
In a 22-year career through 1984 morgan scored 1650 runs stole 689 bases hit 268 homers and batted 27-1 but those stats hardly reflected the force created on the field by the leftyswinging no 8
Confident and cocky he also was copied his habit of flapping his back elbow as a way to keep it high when hitting was imitated by many a little leaguer in cincinnati and beyond.
Health issues had slowed down morgan in recent years knee surgery forced him to use a cane when -        he went onto the field at great american ball park before the 2015 allstar game and he later needed a bone marrow transplant for an illness.
In his prime morgan helped to revolutionize the game with his quickness and many talents especially once he hit the turf at riverfront stadium his statue outside great american ball park portrays him in motion naturally.
“packed unusual power into his extraordinarily quick 150lb fireplug frame” he was praised on his hall of fame plaque
There were moments of silence held at petco park in san diego before the tampa bay rays and houston astros played monday in game 2 of the al championship series and at globe life field in arlington texas before the los angeles dodgers and atlanta braves met in the nl championship series opener.
“he meant a lot to us a lot to me a lot to baseball a lot to african americans around the country a lot to players that were considered undersized” said astros manager dusty baker a longtime friend and national league rival “he was the one of the first examples of speed and power for a guy they said was too small to play”
Morgan got his start with houston in 1963 when the team was called the 45s and still played on grass once he became a fulltime player in 1965 when the club became the astros and moved into the astrodome he began to provide a glimpse of what speedy multiskilled players could do on the new kind of turf.
The reds had already built a formidable team but they came up short in 1970 losing to baltimore in the world series cincinnati made a shocking trade for morgan after the 197-1 season giving up slugger lee may and allstar second baseman tommy helms in an eightplayer swap.
Morgan turned out to be exactly what the reds needed to take the next step.
“joe made us better and we made him better” rose said “we put him in the spotlight it was a perfect fit.”
Rose was the dashing singles hitter on his way to becoming the game’s career hits leader bench supplied the power perez was the clutch hitter and morgan did a bit of everything slashing hits and stealing bases whenever needed.
Skilled at drawing walks and helped by a small strike zone morgan led the nl in onbase percentage in four of his first five years with the reds and finished with a career mark of 392
“that’s when the game went to more speed” rose once said “there were guys who did more but joe stole bases when everyone at the park knew he would he didn’t waste steals he made them count joe probably could have stolen more lots of guys just steal to run up the numbers and then they can’t when it counts to win the game joe made them count.”
Morgan scored a major leagueleading 122 runs in his first season with the reds and they reached the 1972 world series where they lost in seven games to oakland.
Morgan hit 327 with 17 homers 94 Rbis and 67 stolen bases in 1975 then followed with a 320 average 27 homers 11-1 Rbis and 60 steals the next year he was only the fifth second baseman in the nl to drive in more than 100 runs and also led the league in both onbase percentage and slugging percentage in 1976.
The next year -        he led off the allstar game at yankee stadium with a home run against future hall of famer Jim palmer.
“small in stature like his idol nellie fox joe played every game at the highest level maybe proving to himself and everyone else that he belong did he ever bench said.
A series of injuries in the late 1970s diminished morgan’s production — the years of throwing his body around on the turf had taken a toll the reds decided to dismantle the big red machine prompting morgan to also leave.
He spent the 1980 season with houston helping the astros to a nl west title he played two years with san francisco —         hitting a home run on the final day of the 1982 season against the rival dodgers to knock the defending champions out of the playoffs — and later was reunited with rose and perez in philadelphia.
Morgan hit two home runs in the -        1983 world series as the phillies lost in five games to baltimore and tripled in his final atbat.
Morgan finished as a career 182 hitter in 50 postseason games he played in 11 different series and batted over 273 in just one of them a stat that surprises many considering his biggame reputation.
Raised in oakland morgan returned to the bay area and played the 1984 season for the athletics before retiring.
Morgan set the nl record for games played at second ranked among the career leaders in walks and was an allstar in every one of his years with the reds.
After his playing career he spent years as an announcer for the reds giants and a’s along with espn nbc abc and cbs he was analyst for espns sunday night telecasts from 19902010 and won two sports emmy awards as an event analyst — espn’s first two wins in the category in 1998 and 2005.
Morgan also was board vice chairman of baseballs hall of fame and on the board of the baseball assistance team.
Morgan was inducted into baseball’s hall of fame in 1990 the reds also inducted him into their hall of fame and         retired his number.
“he did it all and he did it all the time” said bench the first member of the big red machine to enter the hall.
“Great father and outstanding businessman he was a friend to so many and respected by all” he said.
Morgan recognized his place on one of baseball’s alltime greatest teams.
″bench probably had the most raw baseball ability of any of us” morgan said before his hall of fame induction “pete obviously had the most determination to make himself the player he was perez was the unsung hero i guess i was just a guy who could do a lot of things.
He is survived by his wife of 30 years theresa twin daughters kelly and ashley and daughters lisa and angela from his first marriage to gloria morgan

The government’s scientific advisers called for a twoweek “circuitbreaker” lockdown three weeks ago it has emerged.
Minutes released by the sage group on monday show boris johnson was urged to shut pubs bars restaurants gyms hair salons and move university teaching online last month.
experts warned him that single interventions were “unlikely” to stem surging covid-19 cases.
Downing street accepted just one of sage’s proposals - to uturn on the prime minister’s backtooffice push and advise britons to work from home where they could.
It comes as professor chris whitty england’s chief medical officer warned “significantly” deeper restrictions may soon be needed because even the baseline for the top “very high” tier under england’s new threetier lockdown system is “not sufficient.” alone to slow infections.
The pm told a downing street briefing on monday night that the latest coronavirus data was “Flashing at us like dashboard warnings on a passenger jet”
Almost 14000 more cases were recorded in the past 24 hours and nightingale field hospitals put on standby in northern england to cope with rising covid-19 hospitalisations.
Minutes from sage’s september 21 meeting state “a package of interventions will need to be adopted to prevent this exponential rise in cases.
“single interventions are unlikely to be able to reduce incidence if schools are to remain open then a wide range of other measures will be required.
“the shortlist of nonpharmaceutical interventions that should be considered for immediate introduction include
“a circuitbreaker short period of lockdown to return incidence to low levels advice to work from home for all those that can
“Banning all contact within the home with members of other households except members of a support bubble
“closure of all bars restaurants cafes indoor gyms and personal services eg hairdressers all university and college teaching to be online unless absolutely essential”
Modelling suggests that 14 days of significant reduction in transmission in october could put the epidemic back 28 days and could significantly reduce the prevalence of infection in december sage added.
As with all interventions the earlier it is implemented in the face of growing incidence the higher the impact.
Prof whitty and the government’s chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance attended the meeting via zoom.
During monday’s downing street briefing prof whitty stressed he was “very confident.” the current measures aren slowing the virus but added “I am not confident — nor is anybody confident — that the tier 3 proposals for the highest rate if you did the absolute base case and nothing more would be enough to get on top of it.
Meanwhile sage scientist professor calum semple warned the new restrictions had come too late and a “circuitbreaker” could be needed at least for london within weeks.
“I and other people who were advocating for quite stringent severe local interventions where necessary three to four weeks ago our fear is now that we’re in another place now” he told BBc radio 4’s pm.
“and that we’re going to need a much firmer intervention perhaps the socalled circuitbreaker in the matter of weeks.
“the outbreak is a bit like a supertanker you put the brakes on but it takes a long time before you see the effect”

Dak prescott’s season is over alex smith came back after nearly two years away the ravens demolished joe burrow and the bengals and the raiders shocked the chiefs.
By benjamin hoffman
Sunday got off to a rocky start when the nfl announced it would delay this week’s game between the denver broncos and the new england patriots because of continuing issues with the coronavirus the decision led to a cascade of changes in the coming schedule and is sure to be a frequent topic of conversation as teams adjust on the fly.
As for the day’s action there were surprising results multiple close games and a feelgood comeback by alex smith that almost no one predicted it was not all good news however the 05 atlanta falcons fired their coach and their general manager and dak prescott of the dallas cowboys sustained a gruesome injury that appears to have ended his season.
Here’s what we learned.
Dak prescott’s recordsetting season is almost assuredly over prescott had scrambled for a 9-yard gain in the third quarter of sunday’s game against the giants when the cowboys quarterback had his legs tangle underneath him as he was tackled his right foot appeared to spin around and the veteran sat on the field clenching his calf as medical staff ran to help him he was in tears as he was taken off the field on the back of a cart and was replaced by andy dalton who led the team to a narrow 3734 victory.
Prescott who threw for at least 450 yards in each of his three previous games — an nfl first — set a record for the most passing yards through the first four games of the season with 1690 the outburst of productivity followed an offseason in which he failed to come to terms with dallas on a longterm contract extension.
No official timetable was given for his recovery but the team confirmed that prescott sustained a compound fracture and dislocation of the ankle and that he would have surgery on it immediately team owner jerry jones said he has “no doubt” prescott will be able to return as the team’s leader eventually and prescott’s brother shared a photo of dak in the hospital smiling but on top of an arduous recovery the ramifications of the injury will likely affect prescott’s contract negotiations with dallas this offseason.
There is no quit in alex smith a devastating knee injury in november 2018 had doctors contemplating amputating the veteran quarterback’s right leg his career was declared over by numerous pundits his team used its firstround pick that offseason on a new quarterback and the world moved on that is everyone moved on except for smith 36 he endured 17 surgeries received medical clearance shortly before the season began and entered the washington football team’s game on sunday after an injury to kyle allen throwing an official pass for the first time in 693 days.
Smith was well short of the longest gap between passes which according to the elias sports bureau belongs to tony adams a career backup who went 3276 days between attempts oct 15 1978 to oct 4 1987 but when you factor in just how unlikely smith’s return was his soso passing day in a 30-10 loss to the los angeles rams was nothing short of phenomenal.
Kansas city needs to work on its concentration the chiefs opened their super bowl defense with four consecutive wins including a dominant effort that ended baltimore’s 14-game regularseason winning streak but on either side of that win over the ravens the chiefs had to survive an overtime scare against the chargers in week 2 and then struggled for much of the game against the cam newtonless patriots in week 4 on sunday that tendency to play down to their competition caught up with the chiefs in a big way as the las vegas raiders who came in as 13point underdogs threw everything they had at the chiefs running up a lead and then staving off a patrick mahomes comeback for a shocking 4032 win at kansas city it was just the 11th time the chiefs have allowed 40 or more points at arrowhead stadium.
You can’t give russell wilson any time the vikings pulled ahead of the seahawks 262-1 midway through the fourth quarter and had the ball and a chance to extend their lead in the final three minutes instead minnesota turned the ball over on downs giving wilson 1 minute 57 seconds to take his team 94 yards wilson only needed 14-2 connecting with dk metcalf for yet another gamewinning touchdown wilson spent much of the game with his team trailing an opponent with a losing record but he left it with his frontrunner status for the nfl’s most valuable player award intact.
The jaguars are good for your selfesteem houston had been in disarray starting the season 04 which resulted in the firing of coach bill o’brien a switch to romeo crennel 73 at head coach is not yet permanent but crennel started off his reign as the oldest head coach in nfl history with a convincing win as deshaun watson threw for 359 yards and three touchdowns while leading houston past jacksonville 30-14 the big question is if houston can do anything like this against a team that fields something resembling an nfl defense
It is not always the guys you expect you’d be forgiven if you’d never heard of travis fulgham or chase claypool before sunday fulgham a secondyear wide receiver for the eagles was a sixthround pick of the detroit lions in 2019 and was waived twice once by detroit once by green bay before ending up in philadelphia claypool a rookie wide receiver for the steelers was a secondround pick this year they came into the day with a combined eight career receptions but more than doubled that as they squared off in one of the more unlikely and entertaining battles you’ll come across.
Fulgham caught 10 passes for 152 yards and a touchdown but that was nothing compared to claypool who had seven catches for 110 yards and three receiving touchdowns while running in a fourth score claypool’s final touchdown of the day came on a 35-yard pass from ben roethlisberger and it put the game away for pittsburgh in a 3829 victory.
‘I’ve been called every name in the book people hate me people love me depending on the week that outside noise isn’t important’
Ryan fitzpatrick who had an absolutely dominant effort on the road against san francisco.
Ryan fitzpatrick has had more than his fair share of ups and downs in a 16season career and this was one of his bigger ups whether it is enough to give him job security with tua tagovailoa waiting in the wings is only truly known by coach brian flores but fitzpatrick’s current ratio of three good games to two bad ones this season certainly makes an argument for keeping him on the field.
Todd gurley ii of the falcons had more rushing yards and an absurd 86 yards a carry but in addition to his 105 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns elliott deserves credit for keeping his team together after the loss of quarterback dak prescott elliott scored his second touchdown just three plays after prescott’s injury and those points proved vital in a game that came down to the final seconds.
‘It’s super cool but it’s not something i go into the game thinking ‘I’m going to try to make history today’’
Chase claypool who became the first rookie wide receiver since 1979 to score four touchdowns in a game.
Claypool had just six receptions over the first three games of his career taking the field for less than 40 percent of his team’s snaps in two of the three games in his fourth game he was absolutely dominant becoming the third rookie wide receiver in nfl history to have four touchdowns in a single game joining jerry butler sept 23 1979 and harlon hill oct 31 1954.
except when it takes more
Browns 32 colts 23 in october 1994 “pulp fiction” “forrest gump.” “the shawshank redemption” and “jurassic park” were all in theaters and the browns coached by bill belichick were 41 since then the browns picked up and moved to baltimore after the 1995 season were resurrected in cleveland in 1999 and had 56 players throw at least one pass but until sunday they had not managed another 41 start.
Raiders 40 chiefs 32 not only did the chiefs lose for the first time since nov 10 2019 they did so at home while watching a team look an awful lot like them the rookie wide receiver henry ruggs iii used his gamechanging speed to burn kansas city’s defense for 113 yards on just two receptions one of which was a 72-yard touchdown.
Cowboys 37 giants 34 dallas has to be happy that they invested in a veteran backup as andy dalton may not be perfect but he’s a lot better than what many teams would have if they lost their franchise quarterback for the season salvaging a win in this game was a start but the execution will obviously need improvement.
Ravens 27 bengals 3 lamar jackson had a day well below his typical standards but baltimore didn’t need much from its offense thanks to a terrific effort from its defense which reminded joe burrow that he is a rookie seven players record a sack for the ravens including patrick queen who had nine tackles a sack and two fumble recoveries the second of which he returned 53 yards for a touchdown.
Seahawks 27 vikings 26 seattle isn’t the only undefeated team but they are the first team to 50 thanks to green bay’s bye week and various delays for other teams caused by the coronavirus for minnesota the biggest concern besides dropping to 14 was a groin injury sustained by running back dalvin cook that could affect him going forward.
Steelers 38 eagles 29 a win is a win but pittsburgh should be concerned both by its secondary struggling against philadelphia and one of the team’s top offseason acquisitions tight end eric ebron having a rough fourth quarter in which he fumbled the ball away in a key situation on one drive and got pushed out of the way for a near interception — the ball hit the ground before it was caught — on the next one.
Dolphins 43 49ers 17 miami outgained san francisco by nearly 200 yards ryan fitzpatrick threw three touchdown passes and Jimmy garoppolo was benched for his own safety in a game that went off the rails immediately for the defending nfc champions.
Rams 30 footballers 10 los angeles got an easy win on the road as jared goff threw for 309 yards the rookie running back cam akers returned from an injury to average 68 yards a carry robert woods hauled in a 56-yard touchdown pass and aaron donald tied his career high with four sacks.
Cardinals 30 jets 10 deandre hopkins’s injured ankle appeared to be healed as he torched the jets for six catches 13-1 yards and a touchdown ruining joe flacco’s first start since week 8 of last season.
Panthers 23 falcons 16 todd gurley turned the clock way back with 12-1 yards on just 14 carries and a touchdown calvin ridley had eight receptions for 136 yards and atlanta still lost by a touchdown at home to a team missing its best player it makes you wonder how this team as constructed could ever win a game so it makes sense that the team fired coach dan dan quinn and general manager thomas dimitroff.
Texans 30 jaguars 14 you’d have to work hard to find a play executed more poorly than a fourthand-1 at the opponent’s 8-yard line in which a team trailing by 137 jacksonville did a direct snap to a running back james robinson had him roll out as if he was going to pass only to have him simply drop the ball with no contact for a turnover that all but decided the game in houston’s favor.

Djokovic the world no 1 has tried repeatedly this year to build on his reputation as a leader and a champion the results have been less than great.
By matthew futterman
Novak Djokovic may look back on these last months as some of the most dread-ful in his career a series of moments that appeared to be filled with opportunity but fizzled in spectacular fashion.
On sunday his troubled year brought the challenge of the greatest claycourt player the game has known and Djokovic flopped dramatically again as he lost to rafael nadal the 13-time french open champion 60 62 75.
To be fair there is no shame in losing to nadal at roland garros nadal is now 1002 on the red clay in paris but Djokovic who won the italian open on clay in rome last month and tore through his early matches at roland garros was supposed to have an opening.
The weather was cool for the autumn version of this event which is usually played in late spring that slowed the ball down and took one of nadal’s favorite weapons — his absurdly highbouncing forehand — out of his arsenal a new heavier ball was supposed to make life even harder for nadal and his power game and favor Djokovic’s ability to find the sharpest angles for his winners midday rain in paris forced organizers to close the roof another supposed advantage for Djokovic.
And then like so many other times in this strange year it all went south so quickly for Djokovic a 17time grand slam champion who had not lost a match he had completed in 2020
He struggled with his serve and failed to win a game in the first set it was more of the same in the second and his errors began to pile up seemingly easy forehands whipped into the net too many of his usually lethal backhands sailed wide
And while Djokovic battled to extend the match in the third set the final moments made clear how inevitable the result had been Djokovic doublefaulted to give nadal the break that allowed him to serve for the third set at 65 a sloppy forehand gave nadal match point and then Djokovic barely moved on the ace that ended the tournament.
“I was not so pleased” Djokovic said of the way things turned out.
That’s the way things have gone for some months now for Djokovic ever since he started the year with a crushing win over dominic thiem in the australian open final for his 17th grand slam title what looked like another year of dominance for the world no 1 came to a halt in march when the spreading coronavirus forced sports to shut down.
In the spring during the lockdown in europe Djokovic posted a series of conversations with his friend chervin jafarieh who serves as a kind of new age guru for the tennis star the conversations were meant to help people add meaning and purpose to their lives but Djokovic’s bizarre talk about the human body being able to make polluted water healthy through prayer and belief overwhelmed whatever good intentions he might have had.
In june he began the adria tour which was supposed to be a series of tournaments that would bring tennis out of its hiatus but it became a kind of superspreading event with Djokovic and several other marquee players being infected with the coronavirus the tour was canceled after significant backlash for parties and other events that had few pandemic precautions.
Then his game on cruise control at the united states open in september with none of his main rivals in the draw Djokovic lost his temper and swatted a ball that hit a line judge in the throat tournament officials bound by the rules disqualified him.
Then came sunday in paris
“I was thinking the conditions were more favorable to me” he said.
If that was the case someone forgot to tell nadal who blistered through the first set and had Djokovic on his heels in a way he rarely finds himself tied at 11 in the second set and serving at 015 Djokovic watched nadal pummel a backhand passing shot down the line it passed just a few feet from where he was standing his head dropped his eyes fell to the red clay his spirit broken.
“I was completely overplayed” he said.
It is possible that Djokovic lost the french open two days before he took the court against nadal.
On friday Djokovic held a twosetstonone lead over stefanos tsitsipas in the semifinals he failed to convert a match point in the third set and the match stretched to five sets over a total of four hours that is not a good way to prepare to play nadal at the french open especially after Djokovic battled stiffness in his neck and back earlier in the tournament.
After the loss on sunday Djokovic tried to be philosophical he was beaten by a better player someone who has proved nearly impossible to beat at this tournament still he made 52 unforced errors compared with 14 for nadal.
He spoke as someone who expects he will have many more chances and at 33 he probably will some will go his way and some will blow up in his face even the best tennis player loses 45 percent of the points he plays perfection will always be elusive the key for Djokovic moving forward will be whether he can limit his unforced errors both on the court and off it.
“I have my flaws as anybody else” he said sunday evening in paris “In the greatest defeats you learn the greatest lessons as a tennis player and a person as well”
