Today (October 12) is Columbus / Indigenous Peoples' Day and what better reason to get some retail therapy in while you're off from work for the day.
Americans in 21 states, plus the District of Columbia, have the day off paid, but retailers remain open. Banks and financial organizations close, as does the U.S. Postal Service. However, the financial stock markets and some couriers remain open and operational.
So whether you're after something snug for winter, a new mattress for your Fall-themed bedroom or need to stock up on some sports gear, there's a deal for everyone this federal holiday.
